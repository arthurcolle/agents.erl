%% Autonomous Goal Formation and Planning Engine
%% Sophisticated system for autonomous goal formation and planning that enables agents to:
%% - Autonomously form goals based on needs, drives, and environmental opportunities
%% - Create hierarchical goal structures with sub-goals and dependencies
%% - Plan sequences of actions to achieve goals
%% - Dynamically adjust goals and plans based on changing circumstances
%% - Balance multiple competing goals and resource constraints
%% - Learn from goal pursuit outcomes to improve future planning
%% - Form meta-goals about the goal formation process itself
