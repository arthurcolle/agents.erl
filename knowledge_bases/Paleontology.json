Paleontological observations have been documented as far back as the 5th century BC. The science became established in the 18th century as a result of Georges Cuvier's work on comparative anatomy, and developed rapidly in the 19th century. The term has been used since 1822[3][b] formed from Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 ('palaios', \"old, ancient\"), \u1f44\u03bd ('on', (gen. 'ontos'), \"being, creature\"), and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 ('logos', \"speech, thought, study\").[5] Paleontology lies on the border between biology and geology, but it differs from archaeology in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn from a wide range of sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, nearly 4 billion years ago.[6] As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.",
