  "content": "The Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC) is a set of three classifications developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to measure and analyse of research and development (R&D) undertaken in Australia and New Zealand. It replaced the Australian Standard Research Classification (ASRC) on 31 March 2008. The ANZSRC is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Australia license.[1] The first ASRC was released in 1993 [2] and was in use until 1998. It comprised three classification schemes; Type of Activity (TOA), Field of Research (FOR) and Socio-Economic Objective (SEO). In 1998, a second ASRC was released [3] with a revised Socio-Economic Objective classification that used a different numbering range, and a Research Field, Course and Discipline (RFCD) classification to replace FORs. This revised classification came into effect in the 2000 collection period, which was due on 31 August 2001.[4] The 2008 standard replaced the RFCD classification with a new 'Field of Research' classification that included approximately 40% more classifiers,[5] using a different numbering scheme to reduce confusion with the 1993 'Field of Research' classification.",
