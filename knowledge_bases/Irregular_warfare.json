  "content": "Irregular warfare (IW) is defined in United States joint doctrine as \"a violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations\" and in U.S. law as \"Department of Defense activities not involving armed conflict that support predetermined United States policy and military objectives conducted by, with, and through regular forces, irregular forces, groups, and individuals.\"[1][2] In practice, control of institutions and infrastructure is also important. Concepts associated with irregular warfare are older than the term itself.[3] Irregular warfare favors indirect warfare and asymmetric warfare approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities in order to erode the adversary's power, influence, and will. It is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of a state and its strategic partners.[4][5][6][7][8] The term \"irregular warfare\" in Joint doctrine was settled upon in distinction from \"traditional warfare\" and \"unconventional warfare\", and to differentiate it as such; it is unrelated to the distinction between \"regular\" and \"irregular forces\".[9]",
