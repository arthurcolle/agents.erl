  "content": "Social control is the regulations, sanctions, mechanisms, and systems that restrict the behaviour of individuals in accordance with social norms and orders. Through both informal and formal means, individuals and groups exercise social control both internally and externally. As an area of social science, social control is studied by researchers of various fields, including anthropology, criminology, law, political science, and sociology.[1][2][3] Social control is considered one of the foundations of social order.[4] Sociologists identify two basic forms of social control. Informal means of control refer to the internalization of norms and values through socialization.[5] Formal means comprise external sanctions enforced by government to prevent the establishment of chaos or anomie in society. Some theorists, such as \u00c9mile Durkheim, refer to formal control as regulation. Social control developed together with civilization, as a rational measure against the uncontrollable forces of nature which tribal organisations were at prey to within archaic tribal societies.[6] Criminal persecutions first emerged around sixth century B.C. as a form of formal social control in Athens, Greece. The purpose of these persecutions were to check certain groups and protect them from malicious interests.[7] Historically, religion also provided an informal moral influence on communities and individuals.[8]",
