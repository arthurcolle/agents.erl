  "content": "In mass communication, digital media is any communication media that operates in conjunction with various encoded machine-readable data formats. Digital content can be created, viewed, distributed, modified, listened to, and preserved on a digital electronic device, including digital data storage media (in contrast to analog electronic media) and digital broadcasting. Digital is defined as any data represented by a series of digits, and media refers to methods of broadcasting or communicating this information. Together, digital media refers to mediums of digitized information broadcast through a screen and/or a speaker.[1] This also includes text, audio, video, and graphics that are transmitted over the internet for viewing or listening to on the internet.[2] Digital media platforms, such as YouTube, Kick, and Twitch, accounted for viewership rates of 27.9 billion hours in 2020.[3] A contributing factor to its part in what is commonly referred to as the digital revolution can be attributed to the use of interconnectivity.[4]",
