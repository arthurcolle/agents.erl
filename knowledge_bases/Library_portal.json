  "content": "A library portal is an interface to access library resources and services through a single access and management point for users: for example, by combining the circulation and catalog functions of an integrated library system (ILS) with additional tools and facilities.[1] A library portal is defined as \"a combination of software components that unify the user experience of discovering and accessing information\" in contrast to a \"single technology\" to provide \"services that support discovery, access and effective use of information.\"[2] In addition to the basic functions of access to the library catalog, and a user's subscription records, significant elements of a library portal normally include: More recently, the focus has been on the discovery goal, which has led to even more difficulties in defining a library portal. The terms \"discovery tools\", \"discovery services\", \"next-generation discovery tool\", and \"next-generation OPAC\" are often used interchangeably. The focus on discovery tools has led to increased competitors in the discovery services market; the competitors that existed in the library portal market have also shifted their focus to this particular function.",
