  "content": "Justification (also called epistemic justification) is a property of beliefs that fulfill certain norms about what a person should believe.[1][2] Epistemologists often identify justification as a component of knowledge distinguishing it from mere true opinion.[3] They study the reasons why someone holds a belief.[4] Epistemologists are concerned with various features of belief, which include the ideas of warrant (a proper justification for holding a belief), knowledge, rationality, and probability, among others. Debates surrounding epistemic justification often involve the structure of justification, including whether there are foundational justified beliefs or whether mere coherence is sufficient for a system of beliefs to qualify as justified. Another major subject of debate is the sources of justification, which might include perceptual experience (the evidence of the senses), reason, and authoritative testimony, among others. \"Justification\" involves the reasons why someone holds a belief that one should hold based on one's current evidence.[4] Justification is a property of beliefs insofar as they are held blamelessly. In other words, a justified belief is a belief that a person is entitled to hold.",
