  "content": "Paleoethnobotany (also spelled palaeoethnobotany), or archaeobotany, is the study of past human-plant interactions through the recovery and analysis of ancient plant remains. Both terms are synonymous, though paleoethnobotany (from the Greek words palaios [\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2] meaning ancient, ethnos [\u03ad\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2] meaning race or ethnicity, and votano [\u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf] meaning plants) is generally used in North America and acknowledges the contribution that ethnographic studies have made towards our current understanding of ancient plant exploitation practices, while the term archaeobotany (from the Greek words archaios [\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c2] meaning ancient and votano) is preferred in Europe and emphasizes the discipline's role within archaeology.[1][2] As a field of study, paleoethnobotany is a subfield of environmental archaeology. It involves the investigation of both ancient environments and human activities related to those environments, as well as an understanding of how the two co-evolved. Plant remains recovered from ancient sediments within the landscape or at archaeological sites serve as the primary evidence for various research avenues within paleoethnobotany, such as the origins of plant domestication, the development of agriculture, paleoenvironmental reconstructions, subsistence strategies, paleodiets, economic structures, and more.[3]",
