  "content": "World literature is used to refer to the world's total national literature and the circulation of works into the wider world beyond their country of origin. In the past, it primarily referred to the masterpieces of Western European literature. However, world literature today is increasingly seen in an international context. Now, readers have access to a wide range of global works in various translations. Many scholars assert that the circulation beyond its country of origin is what makes a work considered world literature. For example, David Damrosch states, \"A work enters into world literature by a double process: first, by being read as literature; second, by circulating out into a broader world beyond its linguistic and cultural point of origin\".[1] Likewise, world literature scholar Venkat Mani believes that the \"worlding\" of literature is brought about by \"information transfer\" largely generated by developments in print culture. Because of the advent of the library, \"Publishers and booksellers who print and sell affordable books, literate citizens who acquire these books, and public libraries that make these books available to those who cannot afford to buy them collectively play a very important role in the \"making\" of world literature\".[2]",
