  "content": "Political culture describes how culture impacts politics. Every political system is embedded in a particular political culture.[1] Political culture is what the people, the voters, the electorates believe and do based on their understanding of the political system in which they have found themselves. These may be regarded as being bad or good placed side by side with global best practices or norms. Gabriel Almond defines it as \"the particular pattern of orientations toward political actions in which every political system is embedded\".[1] Lucian Pye's definition is that \"Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system\".[1] Mar\u00eda Eugenia V\u00e1zquez Semadeni defines political culture as \"the set of discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their political demands and put them at stake.\"[2]",
