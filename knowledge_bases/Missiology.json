  "content": "Missiology is the academic study of the Christian mission history and methodology. It began to be developed as an academic discipline in the 19th century.[1] Broadly speaking, missiology is \"an interdisciplinary field of inquiry into Christian mission or missions that utilizes theological, historical, and various social scientific methods.\"[2] It has historically focused on the missionary and evangelistic work of Protestant and Catholic denominations from Europe and North America into other continents. But the decline in Christian numbers in the West has been met by the rise of Evangelical and Pentecostal Christians in the Majority World \"for which mission and evangelism are their raison d'\u00eatre.\"[2] Through missionary work in new contexts and the gradual shift in the World Christian population from the West to the non-Western world, Christians have had to grapple with new questions. While biblical and theologically rooted, missiology has therefore sought a deep engagement in the social sciences, in disciplines such as anthropology, history, geography, communication theory, comparative religious studies, social studies, education, psychology, and inter-religious relations.[3] Missiology has thus included topics like inculturation, contextualization, interfaith relations, and reverse mission.[2]",
