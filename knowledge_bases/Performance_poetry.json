  "content": "Performance poetry is poetry that is specifically composed for or during a performance before an audience. It covers a variety of styles and genres. The phenomenon of performance poetry, a kind of poetry specifically made for and offered during a performance before an audience goes back to Dada, the term itself only emerged later. On June 23, 1916, Hugo Ball performed one of the first sound poems, Gadji beri bimba at the Cabaret Voltaire in Z\u00fcrich, dressed in a cardboard costume so that he had to be carried onto the stage.[1] The actual birthplace of performance poetry is therefore Z\u00fcrich. Since then the spectrum ranges from Kurt Schwitters\u2019 own recitation of his wellknown Ursonate to the recitations of \"otto's pug\" by German poet Ernst Jandl and a typ of performance that is mixed from impromptu speech, body language and theatricality such as Natias Neutert\u2019s Diogenes Synopsis\u2019\u2019.[2] The term performance poetry originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet Hedwig Gorski, whose audio recordings achieved success on spoken word radio programs around the world.[3] Her band, East of Eden Band, produced music and poetry collaborations, allowing cassettes of her live radio broadcast recordings to stay in rotation with popular underground music recordings on some radio stations. Gorski, an art school graduate, tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time.",
