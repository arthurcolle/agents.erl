  "content": "Orthopedic surgery or orthopedics (alternative spelling orthopaedics) is the branch of surgery concerned with conditions involving the musculoskeletal system.[1] Orthopedic surgeons use both surgical and nonsurgical means to treat musculoskeletal trauma, spine diseases, sports injuries, degenerative diseases, infections, tumors, and congenital disorders. Nicholas Andry coined the word in French as orthop\u00e9die, derived from the Ancient Greek words \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 orthos (\"correct\", \"straight\") and \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03bd paidion (\"child\"), and published Orthopedie (translated as Orthop\u00e6dia: Or the Art of Correcting and Preventing Deformities in Children[2]) in 1741. The word was assimilated into English as orthop\u00e6dics; the ligature \u00e6 was common in that era for ae in Greek- and Latin-based words. As the name implies, the discipline was initially developed with attention to children, but the correction of spinal and bone deformities in all stages of life eventually became the cornerstone of orthopedic practice.[citation needed]",
