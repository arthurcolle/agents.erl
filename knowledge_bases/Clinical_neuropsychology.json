  "content": "Clinical neuropsychology is a sub-field of cognitive science and psychology concerned with the applied science of brain-behaviour relationships. Clinical neuropsychologists use this knowledge in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and or rehabilitation of patients across the lifespan with neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, as well as other cognitive and learning disorders.[1] The branch of neuropsychology associated with children and young people is called pediatric neuropsychology. Clinical neuropsychology is a specialized form of clinical psychology[2] with stringent laws in place to maintain evidence as a focal point of treatment and research within the field.[2] The assessment and rehabilitation of neuropsychopathologies is the focus for a clinical neuropsychologist.[2] A clinical neuropsychologist must be able to determine whether a symptom(s) was caused by an injury to the head. This is done by interviewing the patient, then determining what actions should be taken to best help the patient.[2] Another duty of a clinical neuropsychologist is to find cerebral abnormalities and possible correlations.[2] Evidence based practice in both research and treatment is paramount to appropriate clinical neuropsychological practice.[2]",
