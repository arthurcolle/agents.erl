  "content": "Space industry refers to economic activities related to manufacturing components that go into outer space (Earth's orbit or beyond), delivering them to those regions, and related services.[1][2][3] Owing to the prominence of satellite-related activities, some sources use the term satellite industry interchangeably with the term space industry.[4] The term space business has also been used.[5] A narrow definition of the space industry typically encompasses only hardware providers (primarily those that manufacture launch vehicles and satellites).[2] This definition does not exclude certain activities, such as space tourism.[6] Therefore, more broadly, the space industry can be described as the activities of the companies and organizations involved in the space economy, and providing goods and services related to space.[2] The space economy has been defined as \"all public and private actors involved in developing and providing space-enabled products and services. It comprises a long value-added chaining, starting with research and development actors and manufacturers of space hardware and ending with the providers of space-enabled products and services to final users.\"[7]",
