  "content": "Wildlife management is the management process influencing interactions among and between wildlife, its habitats and people to achieve predefined impacts.[1][2][3] Wildlife management can include wildlife conservation, population control, gamekeeping, wildlife contraceptive and pest control.[4][5] Wildlife management aims to halt the loss in the Earth's biodiversity,[6][7] by taking into consideration ecological principles such as carrying capacity, disturbance and succession, and environmental conditions such as physical geography, pedology and hydrology.[8][9][10][11] Most wildlife biologists are concerned with the conservation and improvement of habitats; although rewilding is increasingly being undertaken.[12][13] Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, nitrification and denitrification, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying.[14] Gamekeeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well-being of game and may include the killing of other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. Aldo Leopold defined wildlife management in 1933 as the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use.[15]",
