  "content": "Technology education[1] is the study of technology, in which students \"learn about the processes and knowledge related to technology\".[2] As a field of study, it covers the human's ability to shape and change the physical world to meet needs, by manipulating materials and tools with techniques. It addresses the disconnect between wide usage and the lack of knowledge about technical components of technologies used and how to fix them.[3] This emergent discipline seeks to contribute to the learners' overall scientific and technological literacy,[4] and technacy. Technology education should not be confused with educational technology. Educational technology focuses on a more narrow subset of technology use that revolves around the use of technology in and for education as opposed to technology education's focus on technology's use in general.[5] Technology education is an offshoot of the Industrial Arts tradition in the United States and the Craft teaching or vocational education in other countries.[4] In 1980, through what was called the \"Futuring Project\", the name of \"industrial arts education\" was changed to be \"technology education\" in New York State; the goal of this movement was to increase students' technological literacy.[6] Since the nature of technology education is significantly different from its predecessor, Industrial Arts teachers underwent inservice education in the mid-1980s while a Technology Training Network was also established by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).[4]",
