  "content": "Astrobotany is an applied sub-discipline of botany that is the study of plants in space environments. It is a branch of astrobiology and botany. Astrobotany concerns both the study of extraterrestrial vegetation discovery, as well as research into the growth of terrestrial vegetation in outer space by humans.[1] It has been a subject of study that plants may be grown in outer space typically in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment in specific space gardens.[2] In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere.[3] Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity.[4] Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews.[4] The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity.[5] This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible space farming in hypo- and micro-gravity.[6][7]",
