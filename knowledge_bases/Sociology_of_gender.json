As one of the most important social structures is status (position that an individual possesses which effects how they are treated by society). One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender.[1] Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term gender for the perceived or projected (self-identified) masculinity or femininity of a person.[2] The term gender role was coined by John Money in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as \"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman.\"[3] According to American gender theorist Judith Butler, a person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to biological sex.[4] Many societies have binary gender systems in which everyone is categorized as male or female. Some societies include a third gender role; for instance, the Native American Two-Spirit people and the Hijras of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a social construct or a biological construct.[5]",
