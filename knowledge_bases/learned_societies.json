  "content": "A learned society (/\u02c8l\u025c\u02d0rn\u026ad/; also scholarly, intellectual, or academic society) is an organization that exists to promote an academic discipline, profession, or a group of related disciplines such as the arts and sciences.[1] Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some qualification, or may be an honour conferred by election.[2] Most learned societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results, and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership.[3] Some of the oldest learned societies are the Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux floraux (founded 1323),[4] Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana (founded 1488), Accademia della Crusca (founded 1583),[5] Accademia dei Lincei (founded 1603),[6] Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise (founded 1635),[7] German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (founded 1652),[8] Royal Society (founded 1660) and French Academy of Sciences (founded 1666).",
