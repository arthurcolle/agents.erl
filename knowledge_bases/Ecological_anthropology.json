  "content": "Ecological anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology and is defined as the \"study of cultural adaptations to environments\".[1] The sub-field is also defined as, \"the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment\".[2] The focus of its research concerns \"how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems\".[1] Ecological anthropology developed from the approach of cultural ecology, and it provided a conceptual framework more suitable for scientific inquiry than the cultural ecology approach.[3] Research pursued under this approach aims to study a wide range of human responses to environmental problems.[3] Ecological anthropologist, Conrad Kottak published arguing[clarification needed] there is an original older 'functionalist', apolitical style ecological anthropology and, as of the time of writing in 1999, a 'new ecological anthropology' was emerging and being recommended consisting of a more complex intersecting global, national, regional and local systems style or approach.[4]",
