  "content": "Malacology[a] is the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (molluscs or mollusks), the second-largest phylum of animals in terms of described species[1] after the arthropods. Mollusks include snails and slugs, clams, and cephalopods, along with numerous other kinds, many of which have shells. Malacology derives from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (malak\u00f3s) 'soft' and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (-log\u00eda) '-logy', 'study of'. Fields within malacological research include taxonomy, ecology and evolution. Several subdivisions of malacology exist, including conchology, devoted to the study of mollusk shells, and teuthology, the study of cephalopods such as octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Applied malacology studies medical, veterinary, and agricultural applications, for example the study of mollusks as vectors of schistosomiasis and other diseases. Archaeology employs malacology to understand the evolution of the climate, the biota of the area, and the usage of the site.[citation needed]",
