Among the world's oldest organized faiths, its adherents exalt an uncreated, benevolent, and all-wise deity known as Ahura Mazda (\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf35\ud802\udf0e\ud802\udf2d\ud802\udf0b \ud802\udf28\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf30\ud802\udf1b\ud802\udf03), who is hailed as the supreme being of the universe. Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu (\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf22\ud802\udf2d\ud802\udf00\u2e31\ud802\udf28\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf0c\ud802\udf25\ud802\udf0c\ud802\udf0c\ud802\udf0e), who is personified as a destructive spirit and the adversary of all things that are good. As such, the Zoroastrian religion combines a dualistic cosmology of good and evil with an eschatological outlook predicting the ultimate triumph of Ahura Mazda over evil.[1] Opinions vary among scholars as to whether Zoroastrianism is monotheistic,[1] polytheistic,[2] henotheistic,[3] or a combination of all three.[4] Zoroastrianism shaped Iranian culture and history, while scholars differ on whether it significantly influenced ancient Western philosophy and the Abrahamic religions,[5][6] or gradually reconciled with other religions and traditions, such as Christianity and Islam.[7]",
