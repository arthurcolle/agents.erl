  "content": "Dermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin.[1][2] It is a speciality with both medical and surgical aspects.[3][4][5] A dermatologist is a specialist medical doctor who manages diseases related to skin, hair, nails, and some cosmetic problems.[2][6] Attested in English in 1819, the word \"dermatology\" derives from the Greek \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (dermatos), genitive of \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 (derma), \"skin\"[7] (itself from \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 dero, \"to flay\"[8]) and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 -logia. Neo-Latin dermatologia was coined in 1630, an anatomical term with various French and German uses attested from the 1730s.[9] In 1708, the first great school of dermatology became a reality at the famous H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis in Paris, and the first textbooks (Willan's, 1798\u20131808) and atlases (Alibert's, 1806\u20131816) appeared in print around the same time.[10] After earning a medical degree (M.D. or D.O.), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for board certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, American Board of Dermatology, or American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology is four years.[11] This training consists of an initial medical, transitional, surgical, or pediatric intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency.[2][12][13] Following this training, one- or two-year post-residency fellowships are available in immunodermatology, phototherapy, laser medicine, Mohs micrographic surgery, cosmetic surgery, dermatopathology, or pediatric dermatology. While these dermatology fellowships offer additional subspecialty training, many dermatologists proficiently provide these services without subspecialty fellowship training. For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.[14][15][16]",
