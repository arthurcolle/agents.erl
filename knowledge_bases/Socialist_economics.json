  "content": "Socialist economics comprises the economic theories, practices and norms of hypothetical and existing socialist economic systems.[1] A socialist economic system is characterized by social ownership and operation of the means of production[2][3][4][5][6][7] that may take the form of autonomous cooperatives or direct public ownership wherein production is carried out directly for use rather than for profit.[8][9][10][11] Socialist systems that utilize markets for allocating capital goods and factors of production among economic units are designated market socialism. When planning is utilized, the economic system is designated as a socialist planned economy. Non-market forms of socialism usually include a system of accounting based on calculation-in-kind to value resources and goods.[12][13] Socialist economics has been associated with different schools of economic thought. Marxian economics provided a foundation for socialism based on analysis of capitalism[14] while neoclassical economics and evolutionary economics provided comprehensive models of socialism.[15] During the 20th century, proposals and models for both socialist planned and market economies were based heavily on neoclassical economics or a synthesis of neoclassical economics with Marxian or institutional economics.[16][17][18][19][20][21]",
