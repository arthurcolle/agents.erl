  "content": "New media are communication technologies that enable or enhance interaction between users as well as interaction between users and content.[1] In the middle of the 1990s, the phrase \"new media\" became widely used as part of a sales pitch for the influx of interactive CD-ROMs for entertainment and education.[2] The new media technologies, sometimes known as Web 2.0, include a wide range of web-related communication tools such as blogs, wikis, online social networking, virtual worlds, and other social media platforms.[3] The phrase \"new media\" refers to computational media that share material online and through computers.[4] New media inspire new ways of thinking about older media. Media do not replace one another in a clear, linear succession, instead evolving in a more complicated network of interconnected feedback loops .[5] What is different about new media is how they specifically refashion traditional media and how older media refashion themselves to meet the challenges of new media.[6]",
