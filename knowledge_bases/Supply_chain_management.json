  "content": "Military supply-chain management is a cross-functional approach to procuring, producing and delivering products and services for military materiel applications. Military supply chain management includes sub-suppliers, suppliers, internal information and funds flow.[1] A supply involves the procurement, distribution, maintenance while in storage, and salvage of supplies, including the determination of kind and quantity of supplies. United States Department of Defense definitions refer to a \"producer phase\" and a \"consumer phase\": A supply chain is a set of linked activities associated with providing material from a raw material stage to an end user as a finished good.[3] Supply control is the process by which an item of supply is controlled within the supply system, including requisitioning, receipt, storage, stock control, shipment, disposition, identification, and accounting.[4] A supply point is a location where supplies, services and materials are located and issued. As a single moving entity,[5] a supply point location is temporary and mobile, normally being occupied for up to 72 hours.[6]",
