  "content": "Several instruments have been used to write in outer space, including different types of pencils and pens. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space conditions. A common misconception states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, the Fisher Space Pen was devised as the result of millions of dollars of unnecessary spending on NASA's part when the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils, making the pen an example of overengineering.[1] In reality, the space pen was independently developed by Paul C. Fisher, founder of the Fisher Pen Company, with $1 million of his own funds.[2][3][4] NASA tested and approved the pen for space use, especially since they were less flammable than pencils,[1] then purchased 400 pens at $2.95 apiece (equivalent to $27 each in 2023).[5] The Soviet Union subsequently also purchased the space pen for its Soyuz spaceflights.",
