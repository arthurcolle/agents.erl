Some common examples of cephalopods are octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Teuthology is a large area of study that covers cephalopod life cycles, reproduction, evolution, anatomy, and taxonomy. Teuthology is a specific branch of malacology, the study of molluscs. A teuthologist is a scientist who studies teuthology. The publication of the English translation of Albin O Ebersbach's thesis on the detailed descriptions of cirrate octopods marks an expansion of access to important taxonomical identifying information in teuthology.[2] The third paper in the series led by Tristian Joseph Verhoeff revisiting cirrate octopods is published.[3] Several papers describing new species of cephalopods were published this year. Two of the papers were the beginning of the series led by Tristian Joseph Verhoeff describing new cirrate octopods discovered around Australia and New Zealand.[4][5] The third paper describes two new Sepiolina species also discovered in Australian waters.[6]",
