  "content": "The concept of human development expands upon the notion of economic development to include social, political and even ethical dimensions. Since the mid-twentieth century, international organisations such as the United Nations and the World Bank have adopted human development as a holistic approach to evaluating a country\u2019s progress that considers living conditions, social relations, individual freedoms and political institutions that contribute to freedom and well-being, in addition to standard measures of income growth.[1] The United Nations Development Programme defines human development as \"the process of enlarging people's choices\", said choices allowing them to \"lead a long and healthy life, to be educated, to enjoy a decent standard of living\", as well as \"political freedom, other guaranteed human rights and various ingredients of self-respect\".[2] Thus, human development is about much more than economic growth, which is only a means of enlarging people's choices.[3] Human Development has roots in ancient philosophy and early economic theory. Aristotle noted that \"Wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking, for it is merely useful for something else\", and Adam Smith and Karl Marx were concerned with human capabilities. The theory grew in importance in the 1980s with the work of Amartya Sen and his Human Capabilities perspective, which played a role in his receiving the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics. Notable early active economists who formulated the modern concept of human development theory were Mahbub ul Haq, \u00dcner Kirdar, and Amartya Sen.[4] The Human Development Index developed for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stems from this early research.[5] In 2000, Sen and Sudhir Anand published a notable development of the theory to address issues in sustainability.[6][7]",
