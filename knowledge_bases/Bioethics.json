  "content": "Bioethics is both a field of study and professional practice, interested in ethical issues related to health (primarily focused on the human, but also increasingly includes animal ethics), including those emerging from advances in biology, medicine, and technologies. It proposes the discussion about moral discernment in society (what decisions are \"good\" or \"bad\" and why) and it is often related to medical policy and practice, but also to broader questions as environment, well-being and public health. Bioethics is concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among life sciences, biotechnology, medicine, politics, law, theology and philosophy. It includes the study of values relating to primary care, other branches of medicine (\"the ethics of the ordinary\"), ethical education in science, animal, and environmental ethics, and public health. The term bioethics (Greek bios, \"life\"; ethos, \"moral nature, behavior\"[1]) was coined in 1927 by Fritz Jahr in an article about a \"bioethical imperative\" regarding the use of animals and plants in scientific research.[2] In 1970, the American biochemist, and oncologist Van Rensselaer Potter used the term to describe the relationship between the biosphere and a growing human population. Potter's work laid the foundation for global ethics, a discipline centered around the link between biology, ecology, medicine, and human values.[3][4] Sargent Shriver, the spouse of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, claimed that he had invented the term \"bioethics\" in the living room of his home in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1970. He stated that he thought of the word after returning from a discussion earlier that evening at Georgetown University, where he discussed with others a possible Kennedy family sponsorship of an institute focused around the \"application of moral philosophy to concrete medical dilemmas\".[5]",
