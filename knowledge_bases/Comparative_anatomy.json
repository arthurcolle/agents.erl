  "name": "Comparative anatomy",
  "content": "Comparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different species. It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny[1] (the evolution of species). The science began in the classical era, continuing in the early modern period with work by Pierre Belon who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans. Comparative anatomy has provided evidence of common descent, and has assisted in the classification of animals.[2] The first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by Alcmaeon of Croton.[3] Leonardo da Vinci made notes for a planned anatomical treatise in which he intended to compare the hands of various animals including bears.[4] Pierre Belon, a French naturalist born in 1517, conducted research and held discussions on dolphin embryos as well as the comparisons between the skeletons of birds to the skeletons of humans. His research led to modern comparative anatomy.[5]",
