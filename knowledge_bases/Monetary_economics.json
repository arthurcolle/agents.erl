  "content": "Monetary economics is the branch of economics that studies the different theories of money: it provides a framework for analyzing money and considers its functions ( as medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account), and it considers how money can gain acceptance purely because of its convenience as a public good.[1] The discipline has historically prefigured, and remains integrally linked to, macroeconomics.[2] This branch also examines the effects of monetary systems, including regulation of money and associated financial institutions[3] and international aspects.[4] Modern analysis has attempted to provide microfoundations for the demand for money[5] and to distinguish valid nominal and real monetary relationships for micro or macro uses, including their influence on the aggregate demand for output.[6] Its methods include deriving and testing the implications of money as a substitute for other assets[7] and as based on explicit frictions.[8] At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th\u201312th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit,[9] cheques, promissory notes,[10] savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt,[11] and banking institutions for loans and deposits.[11]",
