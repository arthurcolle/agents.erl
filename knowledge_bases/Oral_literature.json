  "content": "Oral literature, orature, or folk literature is a genre of literature that is spoken or sung in contrast to that which is written, though much oral literature has been transcribed.[1] There is no standard definition, as anthropologists have used varying descriptions for oral literature or folk literature. A broad conceptualization refers to it as literature characterized by oral transmission and the absence of any fixed form. It includes the stories, legends, and history passed through generations in a spoken form.[2] Pre-literate societies, by definition, have no written literature, but may possess rich and varied oral traditions\u2014such as folk epics, folk narratives (including fairy tales and fables), folk drama, proverbs and folksongs\u2014that effectively constitute an oral literature. Even when these are collected and published by scholars such as folklorists and paremiographers, the result is still often referred to as \"oral literature\". The different genres of oral literature pose classification challenges to scholars because of cultural dynamism in the modern digital age.[3]",
