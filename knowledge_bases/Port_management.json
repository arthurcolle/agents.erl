  "content": "Port management involves the management of ports. According to a syllabus of the United Nations University: There are three broad port business models: In 2008 The World Ports Climate Declaration (WPCD) was adopted by 55 of the world\u2019s largest ports, committing to the long-term work on implementation of initiatives addressing environmental issues.[3] Another notable initiative, The Green Marine (GM) certification program, in which North American maritime corporations, including ports, seek to reduce their environmental impacts, was founded in 2007.[4] An evaluation of this program for Canadian ports over the course of eight years, however, show that only 7 out of 18 major ports \u201cproactively integrated sustainability into their operations\u201d.[5] The importance of environmental port regulation and management owes to the fact that the activities of ports are positioned in the intersection between energy and transport systems and connect a network of different sectors, markets, and value chains, making them a central part of the global economy.[6] While several functional activities are centered around ports, such as cargo handling and storage operations, intermodal connection, industrial activities, and port expansion, the most prevalent port activity is that of shipping, making the regulation of ports primarily driven by the IMO.[7]",
