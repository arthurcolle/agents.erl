  "content": "In mathematics, the branch of real analysis studies the behavior of real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions.[1] Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include convergence, limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability and integrability. Real analysis is distinguished from complex analysis, which deals with the study of complex numbers and their functions. The theorems of real analysis rely on the properties of the real number system, which must be established. The real number system consists of an uncountable set ( R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } ), together with two binary operations denoted + and \u22c5, and a total order denoted \u2264. The operations make the real numbers a field, and, along with the order, an ordered field. The real number system is the unique complete ordered field, in the sense that any other complete ordered field is isomorphic to it. Intuitively, completeness means that there are no 'gaps' (or 'holes') in the real numbers. This property distinguishes the real numbers from other ordered fields (e.g., the rational numbers Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Q} } ) and is critical to the proof of several key properties of functions of the real numbers. The completeness of the reals is often conveniently expressed as the least upper bound property (see below).",
