  "content": "A curator (from Latin: cura, meaning 'to take care')[1] is a manager or overseer. When working with cultural organizations, a curator is typically a \"collections curator\" or an \"exhibitions curator\", and has multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. The term \"curator\" may designate the head of any given division, not limited to museums. Curator roles include \"community curators\", \"literary curators\", \"digital curators\", and \"biocurators\". A \"collections curator\", a \"museum curator\", or a \"keeper\" of a cultural heritage institution (e.g., gallery, museum, library, or archive) is a content specialist charged with an institution's collections and involved with the interpretation of heritage material including historical artifacts. A collections curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort\u2014artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections. In smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for collections care. A curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper packaging of object for transportation, and shares research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums, such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.",
