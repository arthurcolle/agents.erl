  "content": "The digital economy is a portmanteau of digital computing and economy, and is an umbrella term that describes how traditional brick-and-mortar economic activities (production, distribution, trade) are being transformed by the Internet and World Wide Web technologies.[1][2] It has also been defined more broadly as the way \"digital technologies are transforming work, organizations, and the economy.\"[3] The digital economy is backed by the spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) across all business sectors to enhance productivity. A phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent, as consumer products are embedded with digital services and devices.[4] According to the WEF, 70% of the global economy will be made up of digital technology over the next 10 years (from 2020 onwards). This is a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the tendency to go online.[5] The future of work, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the digital economy.[6] More people are now working online, and with the increase of online activity that contributes to the global economy, companies that support the systems of the Internet are more profitable.[7]",
