  "content": "Organizational behavior or organisational behaviour (see spelling differences) is the \"study of human behavior in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself\".[1] Organizational behavioral research can be categorized in at least three ways:[2] Chester Barnard recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization.[3] Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior research is \"to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life\".[4] Miner (2006) mentioned that \"there is a certain arbitrariness\" in identifying a \"point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline\" (p. 56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s.[5] He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add \"organizational\" to its name until 1970, \"long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence\" (p. 56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.[6][7]",
