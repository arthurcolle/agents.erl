The field can be broadly divided into a classical period and a contemporary one, known as \"new economic sociology\". The classical period was concerned particularly with modernity and its constituent aspects, including rationalisation, secularisation, urbanisation, and social stratification. As sociology arose primarily as a reaction to capitalist modernity, economics played a role in much classic sociological inquiry. The specific term \"economic sociology\" was first coined by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be used in the works of \u00c9mile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel between 1890 and 1920.[1] Weber's work regarding the relationship between economics and religion and the cultural \"disenchantment\" of the modern West is perhaps most representative of the approach set forth in the classic period of economic sociology.",
