As a field of study it is interested in all aspects of life, including contemporary as well as historical influences, that impact and alter health and wellbeing.[1][2] It establishes that, from birth to death, social processes interweave and influence health and wellbeing. These influences may include location of upbringing, how illness is understood and framed by immediate community members, or the impact that technology has on health. As such, it outlines that both health and the medical science that engages it are social constructs; that the way of knowing illness, wellbeing, and interactions with them are socially interpreted.[3][4] Health sociology uses this insight to critique long-established ideas around the human body as a mechanical entity alongside disrupting the idea that the mind and body can be treated as distinct spaces. This biomedical model is viewed as not holistically placing humans within the wider social, cultural, economic, political, and environmental contexts that play a large part in how health and wellbeing are deprived, maintained, or improved. Alternative models include the biopsychosocial model[5][6] which aims to incorporate these elements alongside the psychological aspect of the mind.",
