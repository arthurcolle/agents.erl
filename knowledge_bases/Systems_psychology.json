  "content": "Systems psychology is a branch of both theoretical psychology and applied psychology that studies human behaviour and experience as complex systems. It is inspired by systems theory and systems thinking, and based on the theoretical work of Roger Barker, Gregory Bateson, Humberto Maturana and others.[1] Groups and individuals are considered as systems in homeostasis. Alternative terms here are \"systemic psychology\", \"systems behavior\", and \"systems-based psychology\".[citation needed] In the scientific literature, different kinds of systems psychology have been mentioned: Ergonomics, also called \"human factors\", is the application of scientific information concerning objects, systems and environment for human use (definition adopted by the International Ergonomics Association in 2007). Ergonomics is commonly described as the way companies design tasks and work areas to maximize the efficiency and quality of their employees' work. However, ergonomics comes into everything which involves people. Work systems, sports and leisure, health and safety should all embody ergonomics principles if well designed.[citation needed]",
