This includes the study of lakes, reservoirs, ponds, rivers, springs, streams, wetlands, and groundwater.[2] Water systems are often categorized as either running (lotic) or standing (lentic).[3] Limnology includes the study of the drainage basin, movement of water through the basin and biogeochemical changes that occur en route. A more recent sub-discipline of limnology, termed landscape limnology, studies, manages, and seeks to conserve these ecosystems using a landscape perspective, by explicitly examining connections between an aquatic ecosystem and its drainage basin. Recently, the need to understand global inland waters as part of the Earth system created a sub-discipline called global limnology.[4] This approach considers processes in inland waters on a global scale, like the role of inland aquatic ecosystems in global biogeochemical cycles.[5][6][7][8][9]",
