  "content": "Gastronomy is the study of the relationship between food and culture, the art of preparing and serving rich or delicate and appetizing food, the cooking styles of particular regions, and the science of good eating.[1] One who is well versed in gastronomy is called a gastronome, while a gastronomist is one who unites theory and practice in the study of gastronomy. Practical gastronomy is associated with the practice and study of the preparation, production, and service of the various foods and beverages, from countries around the world. It is related with a system and process approach, focused on recipes, techniques and cookery books. Food gastronomy is connected with food and beverages and their genesis. Technical gastronomy underpins practical gastronomy, introducing a rigorous approach to evaluation of gastronomic topics.[2][3] Archestratus wrote a guide to the foods of the Mediterranean in the form of a poem called \"Gastronomy\", according to Chrysippus of Tyana; only fragmentary quotations remain. The word is a compound of Greek \u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1(\u03bf)- 'stomach' and \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 lit. 'custom', modeled on 'astronomy'.[4] It was revived in 1801 as the title of a poem by Joseph Berchoux [fr].[5][6] It was Brillat-Savarin, in his Physiologie du go\u00fbt (1825) who systematized the study of food and cooking under this name.[7]",
