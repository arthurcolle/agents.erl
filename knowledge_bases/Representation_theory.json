  "name": "Representation theory",
  "content": "Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies abstract algebraic structures by representing their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces, and studies modules over these abstract algebraic structures.[1][2] In essence, a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices and their algebraic operations (for example, matrix addition, matrix multiplication). The algebraic objects amenable to such a description include groups, associative algebras and Lie algebras. The most prominent of these (and historically the first) is the representation theory of groups, in which elements of a group are represented by invertible matrices such that the group operation is matrix multiplication.[3][4] Representation theory is a useful method because it reduces problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra, a subject that is well understood.[5][6] Representations of more abstract objects in terms of familiar linear algebra can elucidate properties and simplify calculations within more abstract theories. For instance, representing a group by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space allows methods of analysis to be applied to the theory of groups.[7][8] Furthermore, representation theory is important in physics because it can describe how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system.[9]",
