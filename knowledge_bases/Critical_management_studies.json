  "content": "Critical management studies (CMS) is a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of management, business and organisation, grounded originally in a critical theory perspective. Today it encompasses a wide range of perspectives that are critical of traditional theories of management and the business schools that generate these theories. It is widely suggested[citation needed] that CMS began with Mats Alvesson and Hugh Willmott's edited collection Critical Management Studies[1] in 1992. CMS initially brought together critical theory and post-structuralist writings, but has since developed in more diverse directions. CMS grew at the same time as the global expansion of business schools, especially in north-western Europe. As the narrative has it, decreases in state funding for social sciences and increases in enrolments in business schools during the 1980s resulted in many academics with graduate training in sociology, history, philosophy or related fields of study ending up with jobs \"training managers\" or training students who wanted to become managers.",
