  "content": "Climate policy or climate change policy is policy about climate change. It is often decided by national governments - for example the climate policy of China. It may include policy on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change, and also adapting to climate change. Or not.[1] National climate policy sometimes conflicts with sub-national or bloc policy, for example the climate change policy of Washington (state) diverges from the climate change policy of the United States,[2] and EU climate policy can conflict with other national policies.[3] Climate policies may have very big co-benefits for health policy such as by: reducing air pollution, increasing walking and cycling, and eating less beef; they may also help energy policy by reducing oil imports.[4] Public support for policies depends on: how effective people think they are in reducing emissions, their impact on poor people, their effect on respondents\u2019 households, and how well they understand them.[5] Climate-economy modelling may help when deciding policy.[6] Policy, such as target dates for net-zero emissions, may be put into law.[7] Tax is usually a good policy.[8]",
