  "content": "Managerial economics is a branch of economics involving the application of economic methods in the organizational decision-making process.[1] Economics is the study of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Managerial economics involves the use of economic theories and principles to make decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources.[2] It guides managers in making decisions relating to the company's customers, competitors, suppliers, and internal operations.[3] Managers use economic frameworks in order to optimize profits, resource allocation and the overall output of the firm, whilst improving efficiency and minimizing unproductive activities.[4] These frameworks assist organizations to make rational, progressive decisions, by analyzing practical problems at both micro and macroeconomic levels.[5] Managerial decisions involve forecasting (making decisions about the future), which involve levels of risk and uncertainty. However, the assistance of managerial economic techniques aid in informing managers in these decisions.[6]",
