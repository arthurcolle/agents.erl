  "content": "Osteopathy, unlike osteopathic medicine, which is a branch of the medical profession in the United States, is a pseudoscientific[1] system of alternative medicine that emphasizes physical manipulation of the body's muscle tissue and bones.[2] In most countries, practitioners of osteopathy are not medically trained and are referred to as osteopaths.[3][4][5] Osteopathic manipulation is the core set of techniques in osteopathy.[6] Parts of osteopathy, such as craniosacral therapy, have been described by Quackwatch as having no therapeutic value and have been labeled by them as pseudoscience and quackery.[7][8] The techniques are based on an ideology created by Andrew Taylor Still (1828\u20131917) which posits the existence of a \"myofascial continuity\"\u2014a tissue layer that \"links every part of the body with every other part\". Osteopaths attempt to diagnose and treat what was originally called \"the osteopathic lesion\", but which is now named \"somatic dysfunction\",[6] by manipulating a person's bones and muscles. Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) techniques are most commonly used to treat back pain and other musculoskeletal issues.[6][non-primary source needed][9]",
