  "content": "Singing is the art of creating music with the voice. It is the oldest form of musical expression, and the human voice can be considered the first musical instrument.[1] The definition of singing varies across sources.[1] Some sources define singing as the act of creating musical sounds with the voice.[2][3][4] Other common definitions include \"the utterance of words or sounds in tuneful succession\"[1] or \"the production of musical tones by means of the human voice\".[5] A person whose profession is singing is called a singer or a vocalist (in jazz or popular music).[6][7] Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art songs or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Many styles of singing exist throughout the world. Singing can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, as part of a ritual, during music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger.[8] Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.",
