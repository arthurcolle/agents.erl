  "content": "Special operations or special ops are military activities conducted, according to NATO, by \"specially designated, organized, selected, trained, and equipped forces using unconventional techniques and modes of employment.\"[1] Special operations may include reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, and counterterrorism, and are typically conducted by small groups of highly trained personnel, emphasizing sufficiency, stealth, speed, and tactical coordination, commonly known as special forces. In World War II, following advice from the British, Australia began raising special forces.[2] The first units to be formed were independent companies, which began training at Wilson's Promontory in Victoria in early 1941 under the tutelage of British instructors. With an establishment of 17 officers and 256 men, the independent companies were trained as \"stay behind\" forces, a role that they were later employed in against the Japanese in the South West Pacific Area during 1942\u201343, most notably fighting a guerrilla campaign in Timor, as well as actions in New Guinea.[3] In all, a total of eight independent companies were raised before they were reorganized in mid-1943 into commando squadrons and placed under the command of the divisional cavalry regiments that were re-designated as cavalry commando regiments. As a part of this structure, a total of 11 commando squadrons were raised.",
