  "name": "Engineering physics",
  "content": "Engineering physics (EP), sometimes engineering science, is the field of study combining pure science disciplines (such as physics, mathematics, chemistry or biology) and engineering disciplines (computer, nuclear, electrical, aerospace, medical, materials, mechanical, etc.).[1][2][3] The name and subject have been used since 1861 by the German physics teacher J. Frick in his publications.[4] It is notable that in many languages and countries, the term for \"Engineering physics\" would be directly translated into English as \"Technical physics\". In some countries, both what would be translated as \"engineering physics\" and what would be translated as \"technical physics\" are disciplines leading to academic degrees. In China, for example, with the former specializing in nuclear power research (i.e. nuclear engineering), and the latter closer to engineering physics.[5] In some universities and their institutions, an engineering (or applied) physics major is a discipline or specialization within the scope of engineering science, or applied science.[6][7][8][9]",
