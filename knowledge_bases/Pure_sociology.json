  "content": "Like rational choice theory, conflict theory, or functionalism, pure sociology is a sociological paradigm \u2014 a strategy for explaining human behavior. Developed by Donald Black as an alternative to individualistic and social-psychological theories, pure sociology was initially used to explain variation in legal behavior.[1] Since then, Black and other pure sociologists have used the strategy to explain terrorism,[2] genocide,[3] lynching,[4] and other forms of conflict management[5] as well as science,[6] art,[7] and religion.[8] Pure sociology explains social life with its social geometry.[9] Social life refers to any instance of human behavior\u2014such as law, suicide, gossip, or art \u2014 while the social geometry of a behavior, also called its social structure, refers to the social characteristics of those involved\u2014such as their degree of past interaction or their level of wealth. To some extent this approach draws from aspects of earlier sociological work, ranging from Durkheim's emphasis on social explanations for individual behavior to later work in the variation of police (and other legal) behavior.",
