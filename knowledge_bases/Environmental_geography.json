  "content": "Integrated geography (also referred to as integrative geography,[1] environmental geography or human\u2013environment geography) is where the branches of human geography and physical geography overlap to describe and explain the spatial aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment,[2] these interactions being called coupled human\u2013environment system. Integrated geography requires an understanding of the dynamics of physical geography, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment (human geography). Thus, to a certain degree, it may be seen as a successor of Physische Anthropogeographie (English: \"physical anthropogeography\")\u2014a term coined by University of Vienna geographer Albrecht Penck in 1924[3]\u2014and geographical cultural or human ecology (Harlan H. Barrows 1923). Integrated geography in the United States is principally influenced by the schools of Carl O. Sauer (Berkeley), whose perspective was rather historical, and Gilbert F. White (Chicago), who developed a more applied view. Integrated geography describes and explains the spatial aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment, called coupled human\u2013environment systems.",
