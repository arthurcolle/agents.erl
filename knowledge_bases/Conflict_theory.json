Conflict theories often draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, or a conflict continuum. Power generally contrasts historically dominant ideologies, economies, currencies or technologies. Accordingly, conflict theories represent attempts at the macro-level analysis of society. Many political philosophers and sociologists have been framed as having conflict theories, dating back as far as Plato's idea of the tripartite soul of The Republic,[1] to Hobbes' ideas in The Leviathan. Other historical political philosophers associated with having \"conflict theories\" include Jean Bodin, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Robert Malthus, Karl Marx, and Georg Simmel.[2] Georg Simmel was one of the earliest sociologists to formally use \"conflict\" as a framework to understand social change, writing about the topic in his 1908 book, \"Conflict and the Web of Group Affiliations\".[3]",
