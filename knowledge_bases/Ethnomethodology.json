According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see \u00a7 Varieties).[4] Ethnomethodology is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.,[5] \"to discover the things that persons in particular situations do, the methods they use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life\". However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.[6]",
