Phenomenology analyses social reality in order to explain the formation and nature of social institutions.[1] The application of phenomenological ideas in sociology, however, is not reduced to the notion of the \"Lifeworld\", nor to \"grand\" theoretical synthesis, such as that of phenomenological sociology.[2] Having developed the initial groundwork for philosophical phenomenology, Edmund Husserl set out to create a method for understanding the properties and structures of consciousness such as, emotions, perceptions of meaning, and aesthetic judgement.[3] Social phenomenologists talk about the social construction of reality. They view social order as a creation of everyday interaction, often looking at conversations to find the methods that people use to maintain social relations.[4]",
