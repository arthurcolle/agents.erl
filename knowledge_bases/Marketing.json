  "content": "Marketing is the act of satisfying and retaining customers.[3] It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.[4] Marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Products can be marketed to other businesses (B2B) or directly to consumers (B2C).[5] Sometimes tasks are contracted to dedicated marketing firms, like a media, market research, or advertising agency. Sometimes, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination. Market orientations are philosophies concerning the factors that should go into market planning.[6] The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, including the channels that will be used to advertise the product,[7][8] is affected by the environment surrounding the product,[9] the results of marketing research and market research,[10][11] and the characteristics of the product's target market.[12] Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product,[5] including use of coupons and other price inducements.[13]",
