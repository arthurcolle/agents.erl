The term apologetics derives from the Ancient Greek word apologia (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1).[1] In the Classical Greek legal system, the prosecution delivered the kategoria (\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1), the accusation or charge, and the defendant replied with an apologia, the defence.[5] The apologia was a formal speech or explanation to reply to and rebut the charges. A famous example is Socrates' Apologia defense, as chronicled in Plato's Apology. In the Koine Greek of the New Testament, the Apostle Paul employs the term apologia in his trial speech to Festus and Agrippa when he says \"I make my defense\" in Acts 26:2.[6] A cognate form appears in Paul's Letter to the Philippians as he is \"defending the gospel\" in Philippians 1:7,[7] and in \"giving an answer\" in 1 Peter 3:15.[8]",
