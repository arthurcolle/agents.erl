  "name": "Value theory",
  "content": "Value theory is the interdisciplinary study of values. Also called axiology, it examines the nature, sources, and types of values. Primarily a branch of philosophy, it is an interdisciplinary field closely associated with social sciences like economics, sociology, anthropology, and psychology. Value is the worth of something, usually understood as a degree that covers both positive and negative magnitudes corresponding to the terms good and bad. Values influence many human endeavors related to emotion, decision-making, and action. Value theorists distinguish between intrinsic and instrumental value. An entity has intrinsic value if it is good in itself, independent of external factors. An entity has instrumental value if it is useful as a means leading to other good things. Some classifications focus on the type of benefit, including economic, moral, political, aesthetic, and religious values. Other categorizations, based on the meaning and function of evaluative terms, discuss attributive, predicative, personal, impersonal, and agent-relative values.",
