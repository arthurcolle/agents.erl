  "content": "Library and Information Science (LIS)[1][2] are two interconnected disciplines that deal with information management. This includes organization, access, collection, and regulation of information, both in physical and digital forms.[3][4] Library science and information science are two original disciplines; however, they are within the same field of study.[5][6] Library science is applied information science.[7] Library science is both an application and a subfield of information science. Due to the strong connection, sometimes the two terms are used synonymously. Library science (previously termed library studies and library economy)[note 1] is an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of information. [citation needed]\ufffc\ufffcMartin Schrettinger, a Bavarian librarian, coined the discipline within his work (1808\u20131828) Versuch eines vollst\u00e4ndigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung eines Bibliothekars.[8] Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order.[9] The first American school for library science was founded by Melvil Dewey at Columbia University in 1887.[10]",
