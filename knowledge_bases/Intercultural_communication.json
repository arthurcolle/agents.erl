  "content": "Cross-cultural communication is a field of study investigating how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavor to communicate across cultures. Intercultural communication is a related field of study.[1] Cross-cultural deals with the comparison of different cultures. In cross-cultural communication, differences are understood and acknowledged, and can bring about individual change, but not collective transformations. In cross-cultural societies, one culture is often considered \u201cthe norm\u201d and all other cultures are compared or contrasted to the dominant culture.[2] During the Cold War, the economy of the United States was largely self-contained because the world was polarized into two separate and competing powers: the East and the West. However, changes and advancements in economic relationships, political systems, and technological options began to break down old cultural barriers. Business transformed from individual-country capitalism to global capitalism. Thus, the study of cross-cultural communication was originally found within businesses and government, both seeking to expand globally. Businesses began to offer language training to their employees and programs were developed to train employees to understand how to act when abroad. With this also came the development of the Foreign Service Institute, or FSI, through the Foreign Service Act of 1946, where government employees received training and prepared for overseas posts.[3] There began also implementation of a \"world view\" perspective in the curriculum of higher education.[4] In 1974, the International Progress Organization, with the support of UNESCO and under the auspices of Senegalese President L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor, held an international conference on \"The Cultural Self-comprehension of Nations\" (Innsbruck, Austria, 27\u201329 July 1974) which called upon United Nations member states \"to organize systematic and global comparative research on the different cultures of the world\" and \"to make all possible efforts for a more intensive training of diplomats in the field of international cultural co-operation ... and to develop the cultural aspects of their foreign policy.\"[5]",
