  "content": "A conceptual system is a system of abstract concepts, of various kinds.[A] The abstract concepts can range \"from numbers, to emotions, and from social roles, to mental states ..\".[A] These abstract concepts are themselves grounded in multiple systems.[A][a] In psychology, a conceptual system is an individual's mental model of the world; in cognitive science the model is gradually diffused to the scientific community; in a society the model can become an institution.[b] In humans, a conceptual system may be understood as kind of a metaphor for the world.[3] A belief system is composed of beliefs; Jonathan Glover, following Meadows (2008)[a] suggests that tenets of belief, once held by tenants, are surprisingly difficult for the tenants to reverse, or to unhold, tenet by tenet.[14][15][9][10] Thomas Nagel (1974) identified a thought experiment for non-humans in \"What is it like to be a bat?\".[16] David Premack and Ann James Premack (1983) assert that some non-humans (such as apes) can understand a non-human language.[17]",
