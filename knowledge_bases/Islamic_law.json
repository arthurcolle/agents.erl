'path (to water)') is a body of religious law that forms a part of the Islamic tradition[1][2][3] based on scriptures of Islam, particularly the Qur'an and hadith.[1] In Islamic terminology shar\u012b\u02bfah refers to immutable, intangible divine law; contrary to fiqh, which refers to its interpretations by Islamic scholars.[4][5][6] Sharia, or fiqh as traditionally known, has always been used alongside customary law from the very beginning in Islamic history;[7][8] has been elaborated and developed over the centuries by legal opinions issued by qualified jurists \u2013 reflecting the tendencies of different schools \u2013 and integrated and with various economic, penal and administrative laws issued by Muslim rulers; and implemented for centuries by judges in the courts[4][6] until recent times, when secularism was widely adopted in Islamic societies. Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence recognizes four sources for Ahkam al-sharia: the Qur'an, sunnah (or authentic ahadith), ijma (lit. consensus) (may be understood as ijma al-ummah (Arabic: \u0625\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0629) \u2013 a whole Islamic community consensus, or ijma al-aimmah (Arabic: \u0625\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0640\u0645\u0640\u0629) \u2013 a consensus by religious authorities),[9] and analogical reasoning.[note 1][12] It distinguishes two principal branches of law, rituals and social dealings; subsections family law, relationships (commercial, political / administrative) and criminal law, in a wide range of topics[4][6] assigning actions \u2013 capable of settling into different categories according to different understandings \u2013 to categories mainly as: mandatory, recommended, neutral, abhorred, and prohibited.[4][5][6] Beyond legal norms, Sharia also enters many areas that are considered private practises today, such as belief, worshipping, ethics,[13][14] clothing and lifestyle, and gives to those in command duties to intervene and regulate them.",
