  "content": "The oud (Arabic: \u0639\u0648\u062f, romanized: \u02bf\u016bd, pronounced [\u0295u\u02d0d])[1][2][3] is a Middle Eastern short-neck lute-type, pear-shaped, fretless stringed instrument[4] (a chordophone in the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs classification of instruments), usually with 11 strings grouped in six courses, but some models have five or seven courses, with 10 or 13 strings respectively. The oud is very similar to other types of lute, and to Western lutes which developed out of the Medieval Islamic oud.[5] Similar instruments have been used in the Middle East, predating Islam in Persia. Different versions of the oud are used in Arabia, Turkey, and other Middle Eastern and Balkan regions.[6] The oud, as a fundamental difference with the western lute, has no frets and a smaller neck. It is the direct successor of the Persian barbat lute.[7] The oldest surviving oud is thought to be in Brussels, at the Museum of Musical Instruments.[8] An early description of the \"modern\" oud was given by 11th-century musician, singer and author Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham (c. 965\u20131040) in his compendium on music \u1e24\u0101w\u012b al-Fun\u016bn wa Salwat al-Ma\u1e25z\u016bn. The first known complete description of the \u201b\u016bd and its construction is found in the epistle Ris\u0101la f\u012b-l-Lu\u1e25\u016bn wa-n-Nagham by 9th-century philosopher of the Arabs Ya\u02bbq\u016bb ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q al-Kind\u012b.[9] Kind\u012b's description stands thus:",
