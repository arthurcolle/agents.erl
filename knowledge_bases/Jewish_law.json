Halakha is based on biblical commandments (mitzvot), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic laws, and the customs and traditions which were compiled in the many books such as the Shulchan Aruch. Halakha is often translated as \"Jewish law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word is derived from the root which means \"to behave\" (also \"to go\" or \"to walk\"). Halakha not only guides religious practices and beliefs; it also guides numerous aspects of day-to-day life.[2] Historically, widespread observance of the laws of the Torah is first in evidence beginning in the second century BCE.[3] In the Jewish diaspora, halakha served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law \u2013 both civil and religious, since no differentiation of them exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and Jewish emancipation, some have come to view the halakha as less binding in day-to-day life, because it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the authoritative, canonical text which is recorded in the Hebrew Bible. Under contemporary Israeli law, certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are, for Jews, under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so they are treated according to halakha. Some minor differences in halakha are found among Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Sephardi Jews, Yemenite, Ethiopian and other Jewish communities which historically lived in isolation.[4]",
