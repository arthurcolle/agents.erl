  "content": "Agricultural science (or agriscience for short[1]) is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. Professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or agriculturists. In the 18th century, Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate) as a fertilizer.[2] In 1843, John Bennet Lawes and Joseph Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term field experiments at Rothamsted Research in England, some of which are still running as of 2018.[3][4][5] In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the Hatch Act of 1887, which used the term \"agricultural science\".[6][7] The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The Smith\u2013Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.[8] For the next 44 years after 1906, federal expenditures on agricultural research in the United States outpaced private expenditures.[9]: xxi",
