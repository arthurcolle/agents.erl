  "content": "In library and archival science, digital preservation is a formal process to ensure that digital information of continuing value remains accessible and usable in the long term.[1] It involves planning, resource allocation, and application of preservation methods and technologies,[2] and combines policies, strategies and actions to ensure access to reformatted and \"born-digital\" content, regardless of the challenges of media failure and technological change. The goal of digital preservation is the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time.[3] The Association for Library Collections and Technical Services Preservation and Reformatting Section of the American Library Association defined digital preservation as combination of \"policies, strategies and actions that ensure access to digital content over time.\"[4] According to the Harrod's Librarian Glossary, digital preservation is the method of keeping digital material alive so that they remain usable as technological advances render original hardware and software specification obsolete.[5]",
