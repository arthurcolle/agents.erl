  "content": "Processual archaeology (formerly, the New Archaeology) is a form of archaeological theory. It had its beginnings in 1958 with the work of Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips, Method and Theory in American Archaeology, in which the pair stated that \"American archaeology is anthropology, or it is nothing\" (Willey and Phillips, 1958:2), a rephrasing of Frederic William Maitland's comment: \"My own belief is that by and by, anthropology will have the choice between being history, and being nothing.\"[1] The idea implied that the goals of archaeology were the goals of anthropology, which were to answer questions about humans and human culture. This was meant to be a critique of the former period in archaeology, the cultural-history phase in which archaeologists thought that information artifacts contained about past culture would be lost once the items became included in the archaeological record. Willey and Phillips believed all that could be done was to catalogue, describe, and create timelines based on the artifacts.[2]",
