  "content": "Ritual warfare (sometimes called endemic warfare) is a state of continual or frequent warfare, such as is found in (but not limited to) some tribal societies. Ritual fighting (or ritual battle or ritual warfare) permits the display of courage, masculinity, and the expression of emotion while resulting in relatively few wounds and even fewer deaths. Thus such a practice can be viewed as a form of conflict-resolution and/or as a psycho-social exercise.[citation needed] Native Americans often engaged in this activity,[citation needed] but the frequency of warfare in most hunter-gatherer cultures is a matter of dispute.[1] Warfare is known to every tribal society, but some societies develop a particular emphasis of warrior culture. Examples includes the Nuer of South Sudan,[2] the M\u0101ori of New Zealand, the Dugum Dani of Papua,[2] and the Yanomami (dubbed \"the Fierce People\") of the Amazon.[2] The culture of inter-tribal warfare has long been present in New Guinea.[1][3] Communal societies are well capable of escalation to all-out wars of annihilation between tribes. Thus, in Amazonas, there was perpetual animosity between the neighboring tribes of the J\u00edvaro. A fundamental difference between wars enacted within the same tribe and against neighboring tribes is such that \"wars between different tribes are in principle wars of extermination\".[4]",
