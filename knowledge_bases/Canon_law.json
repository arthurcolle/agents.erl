  "content": "Canon law (from Ancient Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, kanon, a 'straight measuring rod, ruler') is a set of ordinances and regulations made by ecclesiastical authority (church leadership) for the government of a Christian organization or church and its members.[1] Canon law includes the internal ecclesiastical law, or operational policy, governing the Catholic Church (both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches), the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, and the individual national churches within the Anglican Communion.[1] The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these four bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was originally[2] a rule adopted by a church council; these canons formed the foundation of canon law. Greek kanon / Ancient Greek: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd,[3] Arabic qaanoon / \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646, Hebrew kaneh / \u05e7\u05b8\u05e0\u05b6\u05d4, 'straight'; a rule, code, standard, or measure; the root meaning in all these languages is 'reed'; see also the Romance-language ancestors of the English word cane.[4][5][6][citation needed]",
