  "content": "Space food is a type of food product created and processed for consumption by astronauts during missions to outer space.[1] Such food has specific requirements to provide a balanced diet and adequate nutrition for individuals working in space while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled weightless environments of crewed spacecraft. Space food is commonly freeze-dried to minimize weight and ensure long shelf life. Then, before eating it is rehydrated. Unmodified food such as items of fruit and, even a sandwich, have been brought into space. Packaging varies including tubes, cans, and sealed plastic packages. In recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging in space programs as a way to share and show off their cultural identity and facilitate intercultural communication. Although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would provide all the needed vitamins and nutrients.[2]",
