Now bioaerosols, these pollen and fungal spores can be transported across an ocean, or even travel around the globe.[4] Due to the high quantities of microbes and the ease of dispersion, Martinus Beijerinck once said \"Everything is everywhere, the environment selects\".[5] This means that aeroplankton are everywhere and have been everywhere, and it solely depends on environmental factors to determine which remain. Aeroplankton are found in significant quantities even in the Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).[6] The effects on climate and cloud chemistry of these atmospheric populations is still under review.",
