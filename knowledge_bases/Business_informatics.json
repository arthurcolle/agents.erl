  "content": "Business informatics (BI) is a discipline combining economics, the economics of digitization, business administration, accounting, internal auditing, information technology (IT), and concepts of computer science. Business informatics centers around creating programming and equipment frameworks which ultimately provide the organization with effective operation based on information technology application.[1] The focus on programming and equipment boosts the value of the analysis of economics and information technology. The BI discipline was created in Germany (in German: Wirtschaftsinformatik).[2] It is an established academic discipline, including bachelor, master, diploma, and PhD programs in Austria, Belgium, Egypt, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey, and is establishing itself in an increasing number of other countries as well, including Finland, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, India and South Africa.",
