  "content": "Paleopathology, also spelled palaeopathology, is the study of ancient diseases and injuries in organisms through the examination of fossils, mummified tissue, skeletal remains, and analysis of coprolites. Specific sources in the study of ancient human diseases may include early documents, illustrations from early books, painting and sculpture from the past. All these objects provide information on the evolution of diseases as well as how past civilizations treated conditions. Studies have historically focused on humans, although there is no evidence that humans are more prone to pathologies than any other animal.[1] The word paleopathology is derived from the Ancient Greek roots of palaios (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2) meaning \"old\", pathos (\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2) meaning \"experience\" or \"suffering\", and -logia (-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1), \"study\".[2][page needed] Paleopathology is an interdisciplinary science, meaning it involves knowledge from many sectors including (but not limited to) \"clinical pathology, human osteology, epidemiology, social anthropology, and archaeology\".[3] It is unlikely that one person can be fluent in all necessary sciences. Therefore, those trained in each are important and make up a collective study. Training in anthropology and archaeology is arguably most important, because the analysis of human remains and ancient artifacts are paramount to the discovery of early disease.",
