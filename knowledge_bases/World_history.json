  "content": "World history or global history as a field of historical study examines history from a global perspective. It emerged centuries ago; some leading practitioners are Voltaire (1694\u20131778), Hegel (1770\u20131831), Karl Marx (1818\u20131883), Oswald Spengler (1880\u20131936), and Arnold J. Toynbee (1889\u20131975). The field became much more active (in terms of university teaching, text books, scholarly journals, and academic associations) in the late 20th century. It is not to be confused with comparative history, which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale. World historians use a thematic approach, with two major focal points: integration (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).[1] World history in the Western tradition is commonly divided into three parts, viz. ancient, medieval, and modern time.[2] The division on ancient and medieval periods is less sharp or absent in the Arabic and Asian historiographies. A synoptic view of universal history led some scholars, beginning with Karl Jaspers,[3] to distinguish the Axial Age synchronous to \"classical antiquity\" of the Western tradition.[4] Jaspers also proposed a more universal periodization\u2014prehistory, history and planetary history. All distinguished earlier periods belong to the second period (history) which is a relatively brief transitory phase between two much longer periods.[3]",
