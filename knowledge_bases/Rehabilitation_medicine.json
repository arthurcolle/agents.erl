  "content": "Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R), also known as physiatry,[1] is a branch of medicine that aims to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to people with physical impairments or disabilities. This can include conditions such as spinal cord injury, brain injury, musculoskeletal injury, stroke, pain and spasticity from muscle, ligament, or nerve damage. PM&R physicians lead rehabilitation teams and are trained in medication management, electrodiagnosis, and targeted injections.[2] A physician having completed training in this field may be referred to as a physiatrist.[citation needed] Physical medicine and rehabilitation encompasses a variety of clinical settings and patient populations.[citation needed] In hospital settings, physiatrists commonly treat patients who have had an amputation, spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other debilitating injuries or conditions. In treating these patients, physiatrists lead a team of physical, occupational, respiratory, and speech therapists, as well as nurses, psychologists, and social workers. [citation needed].",
