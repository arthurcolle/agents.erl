  "content": "Live action is a form of cinematography or videography that uses photography instead of animation. Some works combine live action with animation to create a live-action animated feature film. Live action is used to define film, video games or similar visual media.[1] Photorealistic animation, particularly modern computer animation, is sometimes erroneously described as \"live action\", as in the case of some media reports about Disney's remake of the traditionally animated The Lion King from 1994.[2][3] According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, live action involves \"real people or animals, not models, or images that are drawn, or produced by computer\".[4] As the normal process of making visual media involves live action, the term itself is usually superfluous. However, it makes an important distinction in situations in which one might normally expect animation, such as when the work is adapted from a video game, or from an animated cartoon.[citation needed] The phrase \"live action\" also occurs within an animation context to refer to non-animated characters: in a live-action/animated film such as Space Jam, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Looney Tunes: Back in Action, or Mary Poppins in which humans and cartoons co-exist. In this case, the \"live-action\" characters are the \"real\" actors, such as Michael Jordan, Bob Hoskins and Julie Andrews, as opposed to the animated \"actors\", such as Roger and Jessica Rabbit.[citation needed]",
