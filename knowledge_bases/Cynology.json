In English, it is a term sometimes used to denote a serious zoological approach to the study of dogs[1] as well as by writers on canine subjects, dog breeders, trainers[2][3] and enthusiasts who study the dog informally.[4][5] Cynology is a classical compound word (from Greek \u03ba\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, ky\u014dn, \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, kynos, 'dog'; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia) referring to the study of dogs. The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized study in English-speaking countries. Similar words are in other languages, such German and Dutch Kynologie. \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd is also the source of the English word cynic, and is directly related to canine and hound. The suffix '-logy' in English words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study. English classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.",
