  "content": "Asian studies is the term used usually in North America and Australia for what in Europe is known as Oriental studies.[1] The field is concerned with the Asian people, their cultures, languages, history and politics. Within the Asian sphere, Asian studies combines aspects of sociology, history, cultural anthropology and many other disciplines to study political, cultural and economic phenomena in Asian traditional and contemporary societies. Asian studies form a field of post-graduate study in many universities. It is a branch of area studies, and many Western universities combine Asian and African studies in a single faculty or institute, like SOAS in London. It is often combined with Islamic studies in a similar way. The history of the discipline in the West is covered under Oriental studies. The International Institute for Asian Studies (IIAS) only considers Asia to the east of the Indus River in its scope of \"Asian Studies\".[2]",
