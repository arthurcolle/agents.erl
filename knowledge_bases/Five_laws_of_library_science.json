  "content": "The five laws of library science is a theory that S. R. Ranganathan proposed in 1931, detailing the principles of operating a library system. Many librarians from around the world accept the laws as the foundations of their philosophy.[1][2] These laws, as presented in Ranganathan's The Five Laws of Library Science, are: The first law of library science, \"Books are for use,\" constitutes the basis for library services. This law means that books in libraries are not meant to be shut away from users. Ranganathan observed that books were often chained to prevent their removal and that the emphasis was on storage and preservation rather than use.[4] He did not reject the notion that preservation and storage were important, but he asserted that the purpose of such activities should be to promote use.[5] Without user access to materials, there is little value in these items. By emphasizing use, Dr. Ranganathan refocused the attention of the field to access-related issues,[2] such as the library's location, loan policies, hours and days of operation, the quality of staffing, and mundane matters, such as library furniture and temperature control.[6]",
