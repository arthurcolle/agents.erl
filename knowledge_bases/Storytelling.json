  "content": "Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment. Every culture has its own narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.[1] Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term \"storytelling\" can refer specifically to oral storytelling but also broadly to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. Storytelling, intertwined with the development of mythologies,[2] predates writing. The earliest forms of storytelling were usually oral, combined with gestures and expressions.[citation needed] Storytelling often has a prominent educational and performative role in religious rituals (for example, the Passover Seder[3]), and some archaeologists[which?] believe that rock art may have served as a form of storytelling for many[quantify] ancient cultures.[4]",
