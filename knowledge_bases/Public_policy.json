  "content": "Public policy is an institutionalized proposal or a decided set of elements like laws, regulations, guidelines, and actions[1][2] to solve or address relevant and real-world problems, guided by a conception[3] and often implemented by programs. These policies govern and include various aspects of life such as education, health care, employment, finance, economics, transportation, and all over elements of society.[4] The implementation of public policy is known as public administration. Public policy can be considered the sum of a government's direct and indirect activities[5] and has been conceptualized in a variety of ways. They are created and/or enacted on behalf of the public, typically by a government. Sometimes they are made by Non-state actors[6] or are made in co-production with communities or citizens,[7][8] which can include potential experts,[9][10][11] scientists, engineers and stakeholders or scientific data, or sometimes use[12][13] some of their results. They are typically made[how?] by policy-makers affiliated with (in democratic polities) currently elected politicians. Therefore, the \"policy process is a complex political process in which there are many actors: elected politicians, political party leaders, pressure groups, civil servants, publicly employed professionals, judges, non-governmental organizations, international agencies, academic experts, journalists and even sometimes citizens who see themselves as the passive recipients of policy.\"[14]",
