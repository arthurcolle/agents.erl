  "content": "In linguistics, syntax (/\u02c8s\u026ant\u00e6ks/ SIN-taks)[1][2] is the study of how words and morphemes combine to form larger units such as phrases and sentences. Central concerns of syntax include word order, grammatical relations, hierarchical sentence structure (constituency),[3] agreement, the nature of crosslinguistic variation, and the relationship between form and meaning (semantics). Diverse approaches, such as generative grammar and functional grammar, offer unique perspectives on syntax, reflecting its complexity and centrality to understanding human language. The word syntax comes from the ancient Greek word \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, meaning an orderly or systematic arrangement, which consists of \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd- (syn-, \"together\" or \"alike\"), and \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 (t\u00e1xis, \"arrangement\"). In Hellenistic Greek, this also specifically developed a use referring to the grammatical order of words, with a slightly altered spelling: \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd. The English term, which first appeared in 1548, is partly borrowed from Latin (syntaxis) and Greek, though the Latin term developed from Greek.[4]",
