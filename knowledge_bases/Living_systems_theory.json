  "content": "Living systems are life forms (or, more colloquially known as living things) treated as a system. They are said to be open self-organizing and said to interact with their environment. These systems are maintained by flows of information, energy and matter. Multiple theories of living systems have been proposed. Such theories attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Some scientists have proposed in the last few decades that a general theory of living systems is required to explain the nature of life.[1] Such a general theory would arise out of the ecological and biological sciences and attempt to map general principles for how all living systems work. Instead of examining phenomena by attempting to break things down into components, a general living systems theory explores phenomena in terms of dynamic patterns of the relationships of organisms with their environment.[2] James Grier Miller's living systems theory is a general theory about the existence of all living systems, their structure, interaction, behavior and development, intended to formalize the concept of life. According to Miller's 1978 book Living Systems, such a system must contain each of twenty \"critical subsystems\" defined by their functions. Miller considers living systems as a type of system. Below the level of living systems, he defines space and time, matter and energy, information and entropy, levels of organization, and physical and conceptual factors, and above living systems ecological, planetary and solar systems, galaxies, etc.[3][4][5] Miller's central thesis is that the multiple levels of living systems (cells, organs, organisms, groups, organizations, societies, supranational systems) are open systems composed of critical and mutually-dependent subsystems that process inputs, throughputs, and outputs of energy and information.[6][7][8] Sepp\u00e4nen (1998) says that Miller applied general systems theory on a broad scale to describe all aspects of living systems.[9] Bailey states that Miller's theory is perhaps the \"most integrative\" social systems theory,[10] clearly distinguishing between matter\u2013energy-processing and information-processing, showing how social systems are linked to biological systems. LST analyzes the irregularities or \"organizational pathologies\" of systems functioning (e.g., system stress and strain, feedback irregularities, information\u2013input overload). It explicates the role of entropy in social research while it equates negentropy with information and order. It emphasizes both structure and process, as well as their interrelations.[11]",
