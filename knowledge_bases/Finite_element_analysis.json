  "content": "Finite element method (FEM) is a popular method for numerically solving differential equations arising in engineering and mathematical modeling. Typical problem areas of interest include the traditional fields of structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid flow, mass transport, and electromagnetic potential. Computers are usually used to perform the calculations required. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. FEM is a general numerical method for solving partial differential equations in two- or three-space variables (i.e., some boundary value problems). There are also studies about using FEM to solve high-dimensional problems.[1] To solve a problem, FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements. This is achieved by a particular space discretization in the space dimensions, which is implemented by the construction of a mesh of the object: the numerical domain for the solution that has a finite number of points. FEM formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of algebraic equations. The method approximates the unknown function over the domain.[2] The simple equations that model these finite elements are then assembled into a larger system of equations that models the entire problem. FEM then approximates a solution by minimizing an associated error function via the calculus of variations.",
