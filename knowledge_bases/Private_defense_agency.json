  "content": "A private defense agency (PDA) is a theoretical enterprise which would provide personal protection and military defense services to individuals who would pay for its services. PDAs are advocated in anarcho-capitalism as a way of enforcing the system of private property.[1] A PDA is distinguished from a private contractor employed by a state which is usually subsidized. Instead, such agencies would in theory be financed primarily by competing insurance and security companies. Benjamin Tucker[2][3][page needed] and Gustave de Molinari first explicitly proposed private defense agencies.[citation needed] The concept later was advanced and expanded upon by anarcho-capitalists who consider the state to be illegitimate and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The Mises Institute published a book of essays entitled The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production.[4] Murray Rothbard in For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto and David D. Friedman in The Machinery of Freedom expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a privatized system of law, police, courts, insurance companies and arbitration agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, victimless crimes and \"crimes against the state\" would be rendered moot, and the legal realm would be limited to contractual disputes and tort damages, as from assault, burglary, pollution, and all other forms of aggression.[5][6] This concept is similar to polycentric law. Within economics, discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the Austrian School, as in Hans Hoppe's article \"The Private Production of Defense\" published by the Mises Institute.[7]",
