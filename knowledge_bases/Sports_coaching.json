  "content": "An athletic coach is a person coaching in sport, involved in the direction, instruction, and training of a sports team or athlete. The original sense of the word Coach is that of a horse-drawn carriage, deriving ultimately from the Hungarian city of Kocs where such vehicles were first made. Students at the University of Oxford in the early nineteenth century used the slang word to refer to a private tutor who would drive a less able student through his examinations just like horse driving.[1] Britain took the lead in upgrading the status of sports in the 19th century. For sports to become professionalized, \"coacher\" had to become established. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.[2] John Wooden had a philosophy of coaching that encouraged planning, organization, and understanding,[3] and that knowledge was important but not everything when being an effective coach.[4] Traditionally coaching expertise or effectiveness has been measured by win\u2013loss percentage, satisfaction of players, or years of coaching experience,[5] but like in teacher expertise those metrics are highly ambiguous.[6] Coaching expertise or effectiveness describes good coaching,[7] which looks at coaching behaviour,[8] dispositions, education, experience,[9] and knowledge.[10]",
