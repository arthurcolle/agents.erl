This type of professional also helps non-athletes and everyday exercisers learn how to enjoy sports and stick to an exercise program. A psychologist is someone that helps with the mental and emotional aspects of someone's state, so a sport psychologist would help people in regales to sports, but also just physical activity.[3] In addition to instruction and training of psychological skills for performance improvement, applied sport psychology may include work with athletes, coaches, and parents regarding injury, rehabilitation, communication, team building, and post-athletic career transitions.[4]",
