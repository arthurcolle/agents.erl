  "content": "Timeline The European country of Italy has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic. During the period of classical antiquity, ancient Etruscans, various Italic peoples (such as the Latins, Samnites, and Umbri), Celts, Magna Graecia colonists, and other ancient peoples inhabited the Italian Peninsula.[1][2] Italy was the birthplace and centre of the ancient Roman civilisation.[3][4] Rome was founded as a kingdom in 753 BC and became a republic in 509 BC. The Roman Republic then unified Italy forming a confederation of the Italic peoples and rose to dominate Western Europe, Northern Africa, and the Near East. After the assassination of Julius Caesar, the Roman Empire dominated Western Europe and the Mediterranean for centuries, contributing to the development of Western culture, philosophy, science and art. With the fall of Rome in AD 476, Italy was fragmented into numerous city-states and regional polities, a situation that would remain until the complete unification of the country in 1871. The maritime republics, in particular Venice and Genoa, rose to prosperity.[5] Central Italy remained under the Papal States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal due to a succession of Byzantine, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon crowns.[6][7] The Italian Renaissance spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art with the start of the modern era.[8]",
