  "content": "Calceology (from Latin calcei \"shoes\" and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logi\u0101, \"-logy\") is the study of footwear, especially historical footwear whether as archaeology, shoe fashion history, or otherwise. It is not yet formally recognized as a field of research. Calceology comprises the examination, registration, research and conservation of leather shoe fragments.[1] A wider definition includes the general study of the ancient footwear, its social and cultural history, technical aspects of pre-industrial shoemaking and associated leather trades, as well as reconstruction of archaeological footwear. Among the early studies of footwear from European archaeological excavations, Roman period footwear figures prominently,[2][3] followed by medieval period finds.[4][5] Scientifically based research was first applied to Roman period finds[6] and later for prehistoric and primitive footwear.[7] With the development of the Goubitz notation system, the technical aspects of the recovered shoe fragments could be clearly presented, allowing researchers a coherent scientific base for leather artifact documentation and correct interpretation.[8] The interest in the history of ancient shoe fashion starts in the 17th century.[9] The interpretation of historical socio-cultural attributes shows the importance of footwear in an archaeological context.[10][11][12] The reference book for calceological studies covers the chronological span from European prehistory (Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages), Roman period, the Middle Ages to the 19th century.[13] Calceological studies outside of Europe address post-1600 sites on the east coast and bays of North America,[14] and the North African sites associated with the Egyptian, Roman and Coptic periods.",
