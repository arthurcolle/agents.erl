  "content": "Informatics (a combination of the words \"information\" and \"automatic\") is the study of computational systems.[1][2] According to the ACM Europe Council and Informatics Europe, informatics is synonymous with computer science and computing as a profession,[3] in which the central notion is transformation of information.[1][4] In some cases, the term \"informatics\" may also be used with different meanings, e.g. in the context of social computing,[5] or in context of library science.[6] In some countries, depending on local interpretations and contexts, the term \"informatics\" is used synonymously to mean information systems, information science, information theory, information engineering, information technology, information processing, or other theoretical or practical fields. In Germany, the term informatics closely corresponds to modern computer science. Accordingly, universities in continental Europe usually translate \"informatics\" as computer science, or sometimes information and computer science, although technical universities may translate it as computer science & engineering.[7][8]",
