  "content": "Mathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or mathematical programming is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criteria, from some set of available alternatives.[1][2] It is generally divided into two subfields: discrete optimization and continuous optimization. Optimization problems arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering[3] to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.[4][5] In the more general approach, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations constitutes a large area of applied mathematics.[6] Optimization problems can be divided into two categories, depending on whether the variables are continuous or discrete:",
