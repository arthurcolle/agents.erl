  "content": "Microsociology is one of the main levels of analysis (or focuses) of sociology, concerning the nature of everyday human social interactions and agency on a small scale: face to face.[1]: 5 Microsociology is based on subjective interpretative analysis rather than statistical or empirical observation,[2]: 18\u201321 and shares close association with the philosophy of phenomenology. Methods include symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology; ethnomethodology in particular has led to many academic sub-divisions and studies such as micro-linguistical research and other related aspects of human social behaviour. Macrosociology, by contrast, concerns the social structure and broader systems. 1800s: Martineau \u00b7 Tocqueville \u00b7 Marx \u00b7 Spencer \u00b7 Le Bon \u00b7 Ward \u00b7 Pareto \u00b7 T\u00f6nnies \u00b7 Veblen \u00b7 Simmel \u00b7 Durkheim \u00b7 Addams \u00b7 Mead \u00b7 Weber \u00b7 Du Bois \u00b7 Mannheim \u00b7 Elias Microsociology exists both as an umbrella term for perspectives which focus on agency, such as Max Weber's theory of social action, and as a body of distinct techniques, particularly in American sociology. The term was conceived by Georges Gurvitch in 1939, borrowing the term from the micro-physics and referring to the irreducible and unstable nature of everyday forms of sociality. It also provided an extra dimension between the studies of social psychology, sociology, and social anthropology\u2014focusing more on individual interaction and thinking within groups, rather than just large social group/societal behaviour. At the micro level, social status and social roles are the most important components of social structure. Microsociology forms an important perspective in many fields of study, including modern psychosocial studies, conversational analysis and human-computer interaction. Microsociology continues to have a profound influence on research in all human fields, often under other names.",
