  "content": "Gynaecology or gynecology (see American and British English spelling differences) is the area of medicine that involves the treatment of women's diseases, especially those of the female reproductive organs. It is often paired with the field of obstetrics, which focuses on pregnancy and childbirth, thereby forming the combined area of obstetrics and gynaecology (OB-GYN). The term comes from Greek and means 'the science of women'.[1][2] Its counterpart is andrology, which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system.[3] The word gynaecology comes from the oblique stem (\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba-) of the Greek word \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ae (gyne) meaning 'woman', and -logia meaning 'study'.[4] The Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus, dated to about 1800 BC, deals with gynaecological diseases, fertility, pregnancy, contraception, etc. The text is divided into thirty-four sections, each section dealing with a specific problem and containing diagnosis and treatment; no prognosis is suggested. Treatments are non-surgical, comprising applying medicines to the affected body part or swallowing them. The womb is at times seen as the source of complaints manifesting themselves in other body parts.[5]",
