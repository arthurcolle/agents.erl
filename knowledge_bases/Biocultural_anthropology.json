It is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture.[1] \"Instead of looking for the underlying biological roots of human behavior, biocultural anthropology attempts to understand how culture affects our biological capacities and limitations.\"[1] Physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective; that is, from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences.[2] After World War II the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology. The shift towards understanding the role of culture to human biology led to the development of Dual inheritance theory in the 1960s. In relation to, and following the development of Dual-inheritance theory, biocultural evolution was introduced and first used in the 1970s.[3] Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological adaptation and variation.[9] Contemporary biocultural anthropologists view culture as having several key roles in human biological variation:",
