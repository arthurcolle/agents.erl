  "content": "Traditional Hinduism (/\u02c8h\u026andu\u02cc\u026az\u0259m/)[1] is an umbrella term[2][3][a] for a range of Indian religious and spiritual traditions (sampradayas)[4][note 1] that are unified by adherence to the concept of dharma, a cosmic order maintained by its followers through rituals and righteous living,[5][6][7][b] as first expounded in the Vedas.[c] The word Hindu is an exonym,[note 2] and while Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world,[note 3] it has also been described by the modern term San\u0101tana Dharma (lit. 'eternal dharma') emphasizing its eternal nature.[note 4] Another endonym for Hinduism is Vaidika Dharma (lit. 'Vedic dharma').[web 1] Hinduism entails diverse systems of thought, marked by a range of shared concepts that discuss theology, mythology, among other topics in textual sources.[8] Hindu texts have been classified into \u015aruti (lit. 'heard') and Sm\u1e5bti (lit. 'remembered'). The major Hindu scriptures are the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas, the Mahabharata (including the Bhagavad Gita), the Ramayana, and the Agamas.[9][10] Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include the karma (action, intent and consequences),[9][11] sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (the cycle of death and rebirth) and the four Puru\u1e63\u0101rthas, proper goals or aims of human life, namely: dharma (ethics/duties), artha (prosperity/work), kama (desires/passions) and moksha (liberation/freedom from passions and ultimately sa\u1e43s\u0101ra).[12][13][14] Hindu religious practices include devotion (bhakti), worship (puja), sacrificial rites (yajna), and meditation (dhyana) and yoga.[15] Hinduism has no central doctrinal authority and many Hindus do not claim to belong to any denomination.[16] However, scholarly studies notify four major denominations: Shaivism, Shaktism, Smartism, and Vaishnavism.[17][18] The six \u0100stika schools of Hindu philosophy that recognise the authority of the Vedas are: Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, and Vedanta.[19][20]",
