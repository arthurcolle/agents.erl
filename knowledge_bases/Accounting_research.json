  "content": "Accounting research examines how accounting is used by individuals, organizations and government as well as the consequences that these practices have. Starting from the assumption that accounting both measures and makes visible certain economic events, accounting research has studied the roles of accounting in organizations and society and the consequences that these practices have for individuals, organizations, governments and capital markets.[1][2] It encompasses a broad range of topics including financial accounting research, management accounting research, auditing research, capital market research, accountability research, social responsibility research and taxation research.[3] Academic accounting research \"addresses all aspects of the accounting profession\" using the scientific method, while research by practicing accountants focuses on solving problems for a client or group of clients.[4] Academic accounting research can make significant contribution to accounting practice,[4][1] although changes in accounting education and the accounting academia in recent decades have led to a divide between academia and practice in accounting.[5]",
