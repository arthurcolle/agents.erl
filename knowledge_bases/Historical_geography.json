  "content": "Historical geography is the branch of geography that studies the ways in which geographic phenomena have changed over time.[1] In its modern form, it is a synthesizing discipline which shares both topical and methodological similarities with history, anthropology, ecology, geology, environmental studies, literary studies, and other fields.[2][3] Although the majority of work in historical geography is considered human geography, the field also encompasses studies of geographic change which are not primarily anthropogenic.[4] Historical geography is often a major component of school and university curricula in geography and social studies.[5] Current research in historical geography is being performed by scholars in more than forty countries.[6] This sub-branch of human geography is closely related to history, environmental history, and historical ecology.[7] Historical geography seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding their interaction with their local environment and surroundings.[8][9]",
