  "content": "Taxonomy is a practice and science concerned with classification or categorization. Typically, there are two parts to it: the development of an underlying scheme of classes (a taxonomy) and the allocation of things to the classes (classification). Originally, taxonomy referred only to the classification of organisms on the basis of shared characteristics. Today it also has a more general sense. It may refer to the classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such work. Thus a taxonomy can be used to organize species, documents, videos or anything else. A taxonomy organizes taxonomic units known as \"taxa\" (singular \"taxon\").\" Many are hierarchies. One function of a taxonomy is to help users more easily find what they are searching for. This may be effected in ways that include a library classification system and a search engine taxonomy. The word was coined in 1813 by the Swiss botanist A. P. de Candolle and is irregularly compounded from the Greek \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, taxis 'order' and \u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, nomos 'law', connected by the French form -o-; the regular form would be taxinomy, as used in the Greek reborrowing \u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1.[1][2]",
