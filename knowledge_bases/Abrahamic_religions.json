  "content": "The Abrahamic religions are a grouping of several religions that revere Abraham in their scripture, with the three largest and most influential being Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The religions share doctrinal, historical, and geographic overlap that supposedly contrasts them with the Dharmic religions of India, Iranian religions, or traditions such as Chinese folk religion.[1][2] However, the categorization has been criticized for oversimplification of different cultural and doctrinal nuances.[3] The term Abrahamic religions (and its variations) is a collective religious descriptor for elements shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[4] It features prominently in interfaith dialogue and political discourse but also has entered academic discourse.[5][6] However, the term has also been criticized for being uncritically adopted.[5] Although historically the term Abrahamic religions was limited to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,[7] restricting the category to these three religions has come under criticism.[8][9] The late-19th-century Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith has been listed as Abrahamic by scholarly sources in various fields[10][11] since it is a monotheistic religion that recognizes Abraham.[12][13]",
