  "content": "Antiquity Medieval Early modern Modern Iran India East-Asia Mysticism is popularly known as becoming one with God or the Absolute,[1] but may refer to any kind of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness which is given a religious or spiritual meaning. It may also refer to the attainment of insight in ultimate or hidden truths, and to human transformation supported by various practices and experiences. The term \"mysticism\" has Ancient Greek origins with various historically determined meanings. Derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03cd\u03c9 m\u00fa\u014d, meaning \"to close\" or \"to conceal\", mysticism came to refer to the biblical, liturgical (and sacramental), spiritual, and contemplative dimensions of early and medieval Christianity.[2] During the early modern period, the definition of mysticism grew to include a broad range of beliefs and ideologies related to \"extraordinary experiences and states of mind\".[3] In modern times, \"mysticism\" has acquired a limited definition, with broad applications, as meaning the aim at the \"union with the Absolute, the Infinite, or God\". This limited definition has been applied to a wide range of religious traditions and practices, valuing \"mystical experience\" as a key element of mysticism.",
