  "content": "Sinology, also referred to as China studies, is a subfield of area studies or East Asian studies involved in social sciences and humanities research on China. It is an academic discipline that focuses on the study of the Chinese civilization primarily through Chinese language, history, culture, literature, philosophy, art, music, cinema, and science. Its origin \"may be traced to the examination which Chinese scholars made of their own civilization.\"[1] The academic field of sinology often refers to Western scholarship. Until the 20th century, it was historically seen as equivalent to philology concerning the Chinese classics and other literature written in the Chinese language.[2] Since then, the scope of sinology has expanded to include Chinese history and palaeography, among other subjects. The terms sinology and sinologist were coined around 1838,[2] derived from Late Latin Sinae, in turn from the Greek Sinae, from the Arabic Sin\u2014which ultimately derive from \"Qin\", i.e. the Qin dynasty.[3]",
