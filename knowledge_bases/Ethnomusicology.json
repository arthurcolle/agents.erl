Ethnomusicologists study music as a reflection of culture and investigate the act of musicking through various immersive, observational, and analytical approaches drawn from other disciplines such as anthropology to understand a culture\u2019s music. This discipline emerged from comparative musicology, initially focusing on non-Western music, but later expanded to embrace the study of any and all different kinds of music of the world. Ethnomusicology development resembled that of Anthropology very closely. Stated broadly, ethnomusicology may be described as a holistic investigation of music in its cultural contexts.[1] The term ethnomusicology itself can be broken down as such: 'ethno' = people, and 'musicology' = the study of music. Thus, in the process of developing the study of music and people, the field of ethnomusicology combines perspectives from a wide variety of disciplines such as folklore, psychology, cultural anthropology, linguistics, comparative musicology, music theory, and history.[2][3] This disciplinary variety has resulted in several distinct definitions of ethnomusicology. As follows, there has not often been a unified definition of ethnomusicology within the field itself. Attitudes and foci of ethnomusicologists have evolved since initial studies in the area of comparative musicology in the early 1900s. For example, in 1956, Willard Rhodes provided his perspective on the definition of ethnomusicology, stating that it is a theoretical and empirical study amalgamating both musicology and anthropology.[4] Then, in 1983, Bruno Nettl characterized ethnomusicology as a product of Western thinking, proclaiming that \"ethnomusicology as western culture knows it is actually a western phenomenon.\"[5] Later, in 1992, Jeff Todd Titon simply described ethnomusicology as the study of \"people making music\".[6]",
