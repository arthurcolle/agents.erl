  "content": "There are several approaches to defining the substance and scope of technology policy. According to the American scientist and policy advisor Lewis M. Branscomb, technology policy concerns the \"public means for nurturing those capabilities and optimizing their applications in the service of national goals and interests\".[1] Branscomb defines technology in this context as \"the aggregation of capabilities, facilities, skills, knowledge, and organization required to successfully create a useful service or product\".[1] Other scholars differentiate between technology policy and science policy, suggesting that the former is about \"the support, enhancement and development of technology\", while the latter focuses on \"the development of science and the training of scientists\".[2] Rigas Arvanitis, at the Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement in France, suggests that \"science and technology policy covers all the public sector measures designed for the creation, funding, support and mobilisation of scientific and technological resources\".[3]",
