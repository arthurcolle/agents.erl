  "content": "Communication physics is one of the applied branches of physics. It deals with various kinds of communication systems.[1] These can range from basic ideas such as mobile phone communication to quantum communication via quantum entanglement.[2] Communication physics is also a journal edition created in 2018 published by Nature Research that aims to publish research that involves a different way of thinking in the research field.[3] Communication physics aims to study and explain how a communication system works. This can be applied in a hard science way via Computer Communication or in the way of how people communicate.[1] An example of communication physics is how computers can transmit and receive data through networks. This would also deal with explaining how these devices encode and decode messages. This physics-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
