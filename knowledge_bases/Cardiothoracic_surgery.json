  "content": "Cardiothoracic surgery is the field of medicine involved in surgical treatment of organs inside the thoracic cavity \u2014 generally treatment of conditions of the heart (heart disease), lungs (lung disease), and other pleural or mediastinal structures. In most countries, cardiothoracic surgery is further subspecialized into cardiac surgery (involving the heart and the great vessels) and thoracic surgery (involving the lungs, esophagus, thymus, etc.); the exceptions are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, India and some European Union countries such as Portugal.[1] A cardiac surgery residency typically comprises anywhere from four to six years (or longer) of training to become a fully qualified surgeon.[2] Cardiac surgery training may be combined with thoracic surgery and/or vascular surgery and called cardiovascular (CV) / cardiothoracic (CT) / cardiovascular thoracic (CVT) surgery. Cardiac surgeons may enter a cardiac surgery residency directly from medical school, or first complete a general surgery residency followed by a fellowship. Cardiac surgeons may further sub-specialize cardiac surgery by doing a fellowship in a variety of topics including pediatric cardiac surgery, cardiac transplantation, adult-acquired heart disease, weak heart issues, and many more problems in the heart.[citation needed]",
