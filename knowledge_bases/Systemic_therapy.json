  "content": "Systemic therapy is a type of psychotherapy that seeks to address people in relationships, dealing with the interactions of groups and their interactional patterns and dynamics.[1] Early forms of systemic therapy were based on cybernetics and systems theory. Systemic therapy practically addresses stagnant behavior patterns within living systems without analyzing their cause. The therapist's role is to introduce creative \"nudges\" to help systems change themselves. This approach is increasingly applied in various fields like business, education, politics, psychiatry, social work, and family medicine. Systemic therapy has its roots in family therapy, or more precisely family systems therapy as it later came to be known. In particular, systemic therapy traces its roots to the Milan school of Mara Selvini Palazzoli,[2][3][4] but also derives from the work of Salvador Minuchin, Murray Bowen, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, as well as Virginia Satir and Jay Haley from MRI in Palo Alto. These early schools of family therapy represented therapeutic adaptations of the larger interdisciplinary field of systems theory which originated in the fields of biology and physiology.",
