This definition of \"herps\" (otherwise called \"herptiles\" or \"herpetofauna\") excludes fish; however, it is not uncommon for herpetological and ichthyological scientific societies to collaborate. For instance, groups such as the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists have co-published journals and hosted conferences to foster the exchange of ideas between the fields.[4] Herpetological societies are formed to promote interest in reptiles and amphibians, both captive and wild.",
