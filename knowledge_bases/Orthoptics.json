  "content": "Orthoptics is a profession allied to the eye care profession. Orthoptists are the experts in diagnosing and treating defects in eye movements and problems with how the eyes work together, called binocular vision. These can be caused by issues with the muscles around the eyes or defects in the nerves enabling the brain to communicate with the eyes. Orthoptists are responsible for the diagnosis and non-surgical management of strabismus (cross-eyed), amblyopia (lazy eye) and eye movement disorders.[1] The word orthoptics comes from the Greek words \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u03cc\u03c2 orthos, \"straight\" and \u1f40\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 optik\u03bfs, \"relating to sight\" and much of the practice of orthoptists concerns disorders of binocular vision and defects of eye movement.[2] Orthoptists are trained professionals who specialize in orthoptic treatment, such as eye patches, eye exercises, prisms or glasses. They commonly work with paediatric patients and also adult patients with neurological conditions such as stroke, brain tumours or multiple sclerosis. With specific training, in some countries orthoptists may be involved in monitoring of some forms of eye disease, such as glaucoma, cataract screening and diabetic retinopathy.[3]",
