  "content": "Modern warfare is warfare that diverges notably from previous military concepts, methods, and technology, emphasizing how combatants must modernize to preserve their battle worthiness.[1] As such, it is an evolving subject, seen differently in different times and places. In its narrowest sense, it is merely a synonym for contemporary warfare. In its widest sense, it includes all warfare since the \"gunpowder revolution\" that marks the start of early modern warfare, but other landmark military developments have been used instead, including the emphasis of artillery marked by the Crimean War, the military reliance on railways beginning with the American Civil War, the launch of the first dreadnought in 1905, or the use of the machine gun, aircraft, tank, or radio in World War I.[2] In other senses, it is tied to the introduction of total war, industrial warfare, mechanized warfare, nuclear warfare,[3] counter-insurgency,[4] or (more recently) the rise of asymmetric warfare also known as fourth-generation warfare.[5]",
