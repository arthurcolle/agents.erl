  "content": "Space and survival is the idea that the long-term survival of the human species and technological civilization requires the building of a spacefaring civilization that utilizes the resources of outer space,[1] and that not doing this might lead to human extinction. A related observation is that the window of opportunity for doing this may be limited due to the decreasing amount of surplus resources that will be available over time as a result of an ever-growing population.[2] The earliest appearance of a connection between space exploration and human survival appears in Louis J. Halle, Jr.'s 1980 article in Foreign Affairs, in which he stated colonization of space will keep humanity safe should global nuclear warfare occur.[3] This idea has received more attention in recent years as advancing technology in the form of reusable launch vehicles and combination launch systems make affordable space travel more feasible.[4] Existential risk are risks of human extinction or similarly severe and irreversible outcome.[5] According to the Future of Humanity Institute, \"humanity's long track record of surviving natural hazards suggests that, measured on a timescale of a few centuries, the existential risk posed by such hazards is rather small. The great bulk of existential risk in the foreseeable future is anthropogenic; that is, arising from human activity.\"[6] Toby Ord argues in The Precipice that some such risks include unaligned artificial general intelligence, pandemics (notably from bioterrorism), catastrophic climate change, and global nuclear warfare.[7][8] He views these as more likely than natural existential risks, such as from supervolcano eruptions or meteor impacts.[9]",
