  "content": "Oceanography (from Ancient Greek \u1f60\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (\u014dkean\u00f3s) 'ocean' and \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae (graph\u1e17) 'writing'), also known as oceanology, sea science, ocean science, and marine science, is the scientific study of the ocean, including its physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. It is an Earth science, which covers a wide range of topics, including ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries; ecosystem dynamics; and plate tectonics and seabed geology. Oceanographers draw upon a wide range of disciplines to deepen their understanding of the world\u2019s oceans, incorporating insights from astronomy, biology, chemistry, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Humans first acquired knowledge of the waves and currents of the seas and oceans in pre-historic times. Observations on tides were recorded by Aristotle and Strabo in 384\u2013322 BC.[1] Early exploration of the oceans was primarily for cartography and mainly limited to its surfaces and of the animals that fishermen brought up in nets, though depth soundings by lead line were taken.",
