  "name": "Mass deacidification",
  "content": "Mass deacidification is a term used in library and information science as one possible measure against the degradation of paper in old books, the so-called \"slow fires\". The goal of the process is to increase the pH of acidic paper. Although acid-free paper has become more common, a large body of acidic paper still exists in books made after the 1850s; this is because of its cheaper and simpler production methods. Acidic paper, especially when exposed to light, air pollution, or high relative humidity, yellows and becomes brittle over time.[1] During mass deacidification an alkaline agent is deposited in the paper to neutralize existing acid and prevent further decay.[2] Mass deacidification is intended for objects on acidic paper that will be lost if no action is performed. Mass deacidification\u2014along with microfilm and lamination\u2014was developed during the early and mid-20th century as a response to the chemical process of hydrolysis by which the fibers that constitute paper, providing its structure and strength, have their bonds broken, resulting in paper that becomes increasingly brittle over time. Environmental pollutants can react with paper to form acids that promote oxidation, creating more acid as a by-product, which results in a positive feedback loop of autocatalytic destruction.[3] Supported in part by grants from the Council on Library Resources, William J. Barrow conducted research into paper decay and found that no more than three percent of books published between 1900 and 1949 would survive more than fifty years. In response to this, a Standing Committee on the Preservation of Research Library Materials was formed by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in 1960.[4]",
