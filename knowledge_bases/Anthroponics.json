  "name": "Anthroponics",
  "content": "Anthroponics is a type of hydroponics system that uses human waste like urine as the source of nutrients for the cultivated plants. In general, the human urine or mixed waste is collected and stored for a period of time, before being applied either directly or passed through a biofilter before reaching the plants. As a form of organic hydroponics, anthroponics combines elements of both hydroponics and aquaponics systems. While human waste has historically been used as a fertilizer, its use in soilless systems is a recent field of research. The earliest published research on the topic is in 1991 by researcher Guterstam, B., in which the treatment of domestic wastewater by an aquaculture and hydroponic mesocosm is described.[1] Since then, other researchers have explored both human mixed waste and human urine as nutrient sources for hydroponic cultivation, studying the potential of such waste,[2] comparisons to traditional fertilizers,[3] both in the context of wastewater treatment,[4][5] agriculture,[6] and even space exploration.[7]",
