  "content": "Helminthology is the study of parasitic worms (helminths). The field studies the taxonomy of helminths and their effects on their hosts. The origin of the first compound of the word is the Greek \u1f15\u03bb\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03c2 - helmins, meaning \"worm\". In the 18th and early 19th century there was wave of publications on helminthology; this period has been described as the science's \"Golden Era\". During that period the authors F\u00e9lix Dujardin,[1] William Blaxland Benham, Peter Simon Pallas, Marcus Elieser Bloch, Otto Friedrich M\u00fcller,[2] Johann Goeze, Friedrich Zenker, Charles Wardell Stiles, Carl Asmund Rudolphi, Otto Friedrich Bernhard von Linstow[3] and Johann Gottfried Bremser started systematic scientific studies of the subject.[4] The Japanese parasitologist Satyu Yamaguti was one of the most active helminthologists of the 20th century; he wrote the six-volume Systema Helminthum.[5][6] This protostome-related article is a stub.
