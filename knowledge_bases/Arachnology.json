  "content": "Arachnology is the scientific study of arachnids, which comprise spiders and related invertebrates such as scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and harvestmen. Those who study spiders and other arachnids are arachnologists. More narrowly, the study of spiders alone (order Araneae) is known as araneology.[1] The word \"arachnology\" derives from the Greek words \u1f00\u03c1\u03ac\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7, arachn\u0113, \"spider\"; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia, \"the study of a particular subject\". The greek word for \"spider\" itself refers to Arachne, the female protagonist of an ancient tale of the Greek Mythology. Arachnologists are primarily responsible for classifying arachnids and studying aspects of their biology. In the popular imagination, they are sometimes referred to as spider experts. Disciplines within arachnology include naming species and determining their evolutionary relationships to one another (taxonomy and systematics), studying how they interact with other members of their species and/or their environment (behavioural ecology), or how they are distributed in different regions and habitats (faunistics). Other arachnologists perform research on the anatomy or physiology of arachnids, including the venom of spiders and scorpions. Others study the impact of spiders in agricultural ecosystems and whether they can be used as biological control agents.",
