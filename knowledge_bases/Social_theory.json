Social theory in an informal nature, or authorship based outside of academic social and political science, may be referred to as \"social criticism\" or \"social commentary\", or \"cultural criticism\" and may be associated both with formal cultural and literary scholarship, as well as other non-academic or journalistic forms of writing.[1] Social theory by definition is used to make distinctions and generalizations among different types of societies, and to analyze modernity as it has emerged in the past few centuries.[2]: 10 Social theory, as it is recognized today, emerged in the 20th century as a distinct discipline, and was largely equated with an attitude of critical thinking and the desire for knowledge through a posteriori methods of discovery, rather than a priori methods of tradition.[citation needed]",
