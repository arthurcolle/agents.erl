  "content": "Sustainability studies is an academic discipline that focuses on the interdisciplinary perspective of the concept of sustainability. Programs include instruction in sustainable development, geography, environmental policies, ethics, ecology, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, economics, natural resources, sociology, and anthropology.[1] Sustainability studies also focus on the importance of climate change, poverty, social justice and environmental justice.[2] More recently, many studies leveraged separate theories to address sustainability issues, including the concept of social learning.[3] Many universities across the world currently offer sustainability studies as a degree program. The main goal of sustainability studies is for students to find ways to develop novel solutions to environmental problems.[4] Towards the end of the 1980s, a new focus emerged globally on the importance of environmental and ecological sustainability. In 1987, the Brundtland Report was delivered by the World Commission on Environment and Development.[5] The commission was appointed to examine the consequences of global environmental change and was chaired by Norway\u2019s Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland.[6] It introduced the concept of sustainable development, defined as \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d.[7] Several definitions have been proposed since then (refer to (Pezzoli, 1997) among others), but after years of debate, researchers asserted that sustainability assessments ought to: integrate economic, environmental, social and increasingly institutional issues as well as to consider their interdependencies; consider the consequences of present actions well into the future; acknowledge the existence of uncertainties concerning the result of our present actions and act with a precautionary bias; engage the public; include equity considerations (intragenerational and intergenerational).[8]",
