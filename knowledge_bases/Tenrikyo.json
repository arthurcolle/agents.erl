Tenrikyo's worldly aim is to teach and promote the Joyous Life, which is cultivated through acts of charity and mindfulness called hinokishin. The primary operations of Tenrikyo today are located at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, which supports 16,833 locally managed churches in Japan,[9] the construction and maintenance of the oyasato-yakata and various community-focused organisations. It has 1.75 million followers in Japan[9] and is estimated to have over 2 million worldwide.[10]",
