  "content": "Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous medicine or folk medicine) comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within the folk beliefs of various societies, including indigenous peoples, before the era of modern medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \"the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement and treatment of physical and mental illness\".[1] In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs. Traditional medicine is a form of alternative medicine. Practices known as traditional medicines include ancient Iranian medicine, Ayurveda, If\u00e1, medieval Islamic medicine, Muti, Rongo\u0101, Siddha medicine, traditional African medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Iranian medicine, traditional Korean medicine, and Unani. Scientific disciplines that study traditional medicine include herbalism, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and medical anthropology.",
