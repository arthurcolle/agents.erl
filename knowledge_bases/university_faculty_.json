    "content": "A faculty is a division within a university or college comprising one subject area or a group of related subject areas, possibly also delimited by level (e.g. undergraduate).[1] In North America, academic divisions are sometimes titled colleges, schools, or departments, with universities occasionally using a mixture of terminology, e.g., Harvard University has a Faculty of Arts and Sciences and a Law School. The medieval University of Bologna, which served as a model for most of the later medieval universities in Europe, had four faculties: students began at the Faculty of Arts, graduates from which could then continue at the higher Faculties of Theology, Law, and Medicine. The privilege to establish these four faculties was usually part of medieval universities' charters, but not every university could do so in practice. The Faculty of Arts took its name from the seven liberal arts: the trivium[Notes 1] (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics) and the quadrivium[Notes 2] (arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy). In German, Scandinavian, Slavic and related universities, it would more often be called the Faculty of Philosophy.[Notes 3] The degree of Magister Artium (Master of Arts) derives its name from the Faculty of Arts, while the degree of Doctor Philosophiae (Doctor of Philosophy) derives its name from the Faculty of Philosophy, German name of the same faculty. Whether called Faculty of Arts or Faculty of Philosophy, it taught a range of subjects with general and fundamental applicability."
