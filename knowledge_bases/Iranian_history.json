  "content": "The history of Iran (or Persia, as it was known in the Western world) is intertwined with Greater Iran, a sociocultural region spanning from Anatolia to the Indus River and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf. Central to this area is modern-day Iran, which covers the bulk of the Iranian plateau. Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC.[1] The western part of the Iranian plateau participated in the traditional ancient Near East with Elam (in Ilam and Khuzestan), Kassites (in Kuhdesht), Gutians (in Luristan) and later with other peoples such as the Urartians (in Oshnavieh and Sardasht) in the southwest of Lake Urmia[2][3][4][5] and Mannaeans (in Piranshahr, Saqqez and Bukan) in the Kurdish area.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel called the Persians the \"first Historical People\".[15] The Iranian empire began in the Iron Age with the rise of the Medes, who unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC.[16] The Achaemenid Empire (550\u2013330 BC), founded by Cyrus the Great, was the largest empire the world had seen, spanning from the Balkans to North Africa and Central Asia. They were succeeded by the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian empires, who governed Iran for almost 1,000 years, making Iran a leading power once again. Persia's arch-rival during this time was the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire.",
