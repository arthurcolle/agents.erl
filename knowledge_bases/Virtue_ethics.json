  "content": "God Schools Relations with: Virtue ethics (also aretaic ethics,[a][1] from Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae [aret\u1e17]) is a philosophical approach that treats virtue and character as the primary subjects of ethics, in contrast to other ethical systems that put consequences of voluntary acts, principles or rules of conduct, or obedience to divine authority in the primary role.[2] Virtue ethics is usually contrasted with two other major approaches in ethics, consequentialism and deontology, which make the goodness of outcomes of an action (consequentialism) and the concept of moral duty (deontology) central. While virtue ethics does not necessarily deny the importance to ethics of goodness of states of affairs or of moral duties, it emphasizes virtue, and sometimes other concepts, like eudaimonia, to an extent that other ethics theories do not.[citation needed] In virtue ethics, a virtue is a characteristic disposition to think, feel, and act well in some domain of life.[3] In contrast, a vice is a characteristic disposition to think, feel, and act poorly in some domain of life. Virtues are not everyday habits; they are character traits, in the sense that they are central to someone\u2019s personality and what they are like as a person.",
