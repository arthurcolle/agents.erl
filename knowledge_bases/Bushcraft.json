  "content": "Bushcraft is the use and practice of skills to survive and thrive in a natural environment. Bushcraft skills include foraging, hunting, fishing, firecraft, and tying knots. Woodcraft is a subset of bushcraft that focuses on survival skills for use in woodland or forest environments. Fieldcraft is a military or tactical form of bushcraft. Bushcraft skills provide basic necessities for human life: food (through foraging, tracking, hunting, trapping, fishing), water sourcing and purification, shelter-building, and firecraft. These may be supplemented with expertise in twine-making, knots and lashings, wood-carving, campcraft, medicine/health, natural navigation, and tool and weapon making. Bushcraft includes skill with tools such as bushcraft knives and axes. A skilled bushcrafter can use these tools to create many different things, from dugout canoes to A-frame shelters. Purpose-built shelters such as tents are commonly used in the wilderness. Tents can also be improvised from a large tarp or blanket. Indigenous shelters include a snow cave or bark lean-to. Natural shelters include caves, the space underneath a tree, or within thickets.[1]",
