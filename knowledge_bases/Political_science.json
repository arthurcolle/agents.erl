It is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power, and the analysis of political activities, political thought, political behavior, and associated constitutions and laws.[1] Specialists in the field are political scientists. Political science is a social science dealing with systems of governance and power, and the analysis of political activities, political institutions, political thought and behavior, and associated constitutions and laws.[1] As a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century and began to separate itself from political philosophy and history.[2] Into the late 19th century, it was still uncommon for political science to be considered a distinct field from history.[2] The term \"political science\" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.[citation needed]",
