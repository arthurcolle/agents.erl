  "content": "Medical education is education related to the practice of being a medical practitioner, including the initial training to become a physician (i.e., medical school and internship) and additional training thereafter (e.g., residency, fellowship, and continuing medical education). Medical education and training varies considerably across the world. Various teaching methodologies have been used in medical education, which is an active area of educational research.[1] Medical education is also the subject-didactic academic field of educating medical doctors at all levels, including entry-level, post-graduate, and continuing medical education. Specific requirements such as entrustable professional activities must be met before moving on in stages of medical education. Medical education applies theories of pedagogy specifically in the context of medical education. Medical education has been a leader in the field of evidence-based education, through the development of evidence syntheses such as the Best Evidence Medical Education collection, formed in 1999, which aimed to \"move from opinion-based education to evidence-based education\".[2] Common evidence-based techniques include the Objective structured clinical examination (commonly known as the 'OSCE) [3] to assess clinical skills, and reliable checklist-based assessments to determine the development of soft skills such as professionalism.[4] However, there is a persistence of ineffective instructional methods in medical education, such as the matching of teaching to learning styles[5] and Edgar Dales' \"Cone of Learning\".[6]",
