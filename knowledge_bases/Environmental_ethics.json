  "content": "In environmental philosophy, environmental ethics is an established field of practical philosophy \"which reconstructs the essential types of argumentation that can be made for protecting natural entities and the sustainable use of natural resources.\"[1] The main competing paradigms are anthropocentrism, physiocentrism (called ecocentrism as well), and theocentrism. Environmental ethics exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including environmental law, environmental sociology, ecotheology, ecological economics, ecology and environmental geography. There are many ethical decisions that human beings make with respect to the environment. These decision raise numerous questions. For example: The academic field of environmental ethics grew up in response to the works of Rachel Carson and Murray Bookchin and events such as the first Earth Day in 1970, when environmentalists started urging philosophers to consider the philosophical aspects of environmental problems. Two papers published in Science had a crucial impact: Lynn White's \"The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis\" (March 1967)[8] and Garrett Hardin's \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" (December 1968).[9] Also influential was Garett Hardin's later essay called \"Exploring New Ethics for Survival\", as well as an essay by Aldo Leopold in his A Sand County Almanac, called \"The Land Ethic\", in which Leopold explicitly claimed that the roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical (1949).[10]",
