  "content": "Population is the term typically used to refer to the number of people in a single area. Governments conduct a census to quantify the size of a resident population within a given jurisdiction. The term is also applied to non-human animals, microorganisms, and plants, and has specific uses within such fields as ecology and genetics. The word population is derived from the Late Latin populatio (a people, a multitude), which itself is derived from the Latin word populus (a people).[1] In sociology and population geography, population refers to a group of human beings with some predefined feature in common, such as location, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.[citation needed] In ecology, a population is a group of organisms of the same species which inhabit the same geographical area and are capable of interbreeding.[2][3] The area of a sexual population is the area where interbreeding is possible between any opposite-sex pair within the area and more probable than cross-breeding with individuals from other areas.[4]",
