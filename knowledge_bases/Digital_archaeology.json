  "content": "Digital archaeology is the application of information technology and digital media to archaeology. [1][2] This includes the use of tools such as databases, 3D models, digital photography, virtual reality, augmented reality, and geographic information systems.[3] Computational archaeology, which covers computer-based analytical methods, can be considered a subfield of digital archaeology, as can virtual archaeology.[4] Digital archaeology plays a key role in data collection, analysis, and public outreach, enhancing the study and preservation of archaeological sites and artifacts. The use of digital technology to conduct archaeological research allows data to be collected without the invasion or destruction of archaeological sites and the cultural heritage they hold, aiding the preservation of archaeological data. This is how many early archaeological sites were discovered in-depth.[5] Applications of this technology have aided the reconstruction of historical monuments and artefacts such as pottery, human fossils, and mummified remains.[1]",
