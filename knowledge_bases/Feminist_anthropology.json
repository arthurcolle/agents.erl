  "content": "Feminist anthropology is a four-field approach to anthropology (archeological, biological, cultural, linguistic) that seeks to transform research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge, using insights from feminist theory.[1] Simultaneously, feminist anthropology challenges essentialist feminist theories developed in Europe and America. While feminists practiced cultural anthropology since its inception (see Margaret Mead and Hortense Powdermaker), it was not until the 1970s that feminist anthropology was formally[citation needed] recognized as a subdiscipline of anthropology. Since then, it has developed its own subsection of the American Anthropological Association \u2013 the Association for Feminist Anthropology \u2013 and its own publication, Feminist Anthropology. Their former journal Voices is now defunct. Feminist anthropology has unfolded through three historical phases beginning in the 1970s: the anthropology of women, the anthropology of gender, and finally feminist anthropology.[2]",
