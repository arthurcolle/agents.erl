  "content": "Civil law is a major \"branch of the law\", in common law legal systems such as those in England and Wales and in the United States, where it stands in contrast to criminal law.[1][2] Private law, which relates to civil wrongs and quasi-contracts, is part of civil law,[3] as is contract law and law of property (excluding property-related crimes, such as theft or vandalism).[4] Civil law may, like criminal law, be divided into substantive law and procedural law.[5] The rights and duties of persons (natural persons and legal persons) amongst themselves is the primary concern of civil law.[6][7] The common law is today as fertile a source for theoretical inquiry as it has ever been. Around the English-speaking world, many scholars of law, philosophy, politics, and history study the theoretical foundations and applications of the common law.[8] When used in the context of a common law legal system, the term civil law means that branch of the law not including criminal law.[1][2] The common law system, which originated in medieval England, is often contrasted with the civil law legal system originating in France and Italy. Whereas the civil law takes the form of legal codes such as the Napoleonic code, the common law comes from uncodified case law that arises as a result of judicial decisions, recognising prior court decisions as legally binding precedent.[9]",
