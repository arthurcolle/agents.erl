  "content": "Myth is a genre of folklore consisting primarily of narratives that play a fundamental role in a society. For scholars, this is very different from the vernacular usage of the term \"myth\" that refers to a belief that is not true. Instead, the veracity of a myth is not a defining criterion.[1] Myths are often endorsed by religious (when they are closely linked to religion or spirituality) and secular authorities.[2] Many societies group their myths, legends, and history together, considering myths and legends to be factual accounts of their remote past.[6] In particular, creation myths take place in a primordial age when the world had not achieved its later form.[10] Origin myths explain how a society's customs, institutions, and taboos were established and sanctified.[2][8] National myths are narratives about a nation's past that symbolize the nation's values. There is a complex relationship between recital of myths and the enactment of rituals. The word \"myth\" comes from Ancient Greek \u03bc\u1fe6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (m\u0233thos),[11] meaning 'speech', 'narrative', or 'fiction'. In turn, Ancient Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (mytholog\u00eda 'story', 'legends', or 'story-telling') combines the word m\u0233thos with the suffix -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (-logia 'study').[12] Accordingly, Plato used mytholog\u00eda as a general term for fiction or story-telling of any kind. This word began was adapted into other European languages in the early 19th century, in a much narrower sense, as a scholarly term for \"[a] traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining a natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events.\"[13][14]",
