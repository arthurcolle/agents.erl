  "content": "Principles of war are rules and guidelines that represent truths in the practice of war and military operations. The earliest known principles of war were documented by Sun Tzu, c. 500 BCE, as well as Chanakya in his Arthashastra c. 350 BCE. Machiavelli published his \"General Rules\" in 1521 which were themselves modeled on Vegetius' Regulae bellorum generales (Epit. 3.26.1\u201333). Henri, Duke of Rohan established his \"Guides\" for war in 1644. Marquis de Silva presented his \"Principles\" for war in 1778. Henry Lloyd proffered his version of \"Rules\" for war in 1781 as well as his \"Axioms\" for war in 1781. Then in 1805, Antoine-Henri Jomini published his \"Maxims\" for war version 1, \"Didactic Resume\" and \"Maxims\" for war version 2. Carl von Clausewitz wrote his version in 1812 building on the work of earlier writers. There are no universally agreed-upon principles of war. The principles of warfare are tied into military doctrine of the various military services. Doctrine, in turn, suggests but does not dictate strategy and tactics.",
