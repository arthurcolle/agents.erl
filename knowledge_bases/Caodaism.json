The full name of the religion is \u0110\u1ea1i \u0110\u1ea1o Tam K\u1ef3 Ph\u1ed5 \u0110\u1ed9 (ch\u1eef H\u00e1n: \u5927\u9053\u4e09\u671f\u666e\u5ea6 'The Great Faith [for the] Third Universal Redemption').[2] Adherents engage in practices such as prayer, veneration of ancestors, nonviolence, and vegetarianism with the goal of union with God and freedom from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra.[3] Estimates of the number of Caodaists in Vietnam vary; government figures estimate 4.4 million Caodaists affiliated to the Cao \u0110\u00e0i T\u00e2y Ninh Holy See, with numbers rising up to 6 million if other branches are added.[4][5][6][7][8]",
