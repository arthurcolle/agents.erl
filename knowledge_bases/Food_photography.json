  "content": "Food photography is a still life photography genre used to create appealing still life photographs of food. As a specialization of commercial photography, its output is used in advertisements, magazines, packaging, menus or cookbooks. Professional food photography is a collaborative effort, usually involving an art director, a photographer, a food stylist, a prop stylist and their assistants.[1] With the advent of social media, amateur food photography has gained popularity among restaurant diners. In advertising, food photography is often \u2013 and sometimes controversially \u2013 used to exaggerate the attractiveness or size of the advertised food, notably fast food.[2] The first known photograph that showed food as a subject was a 1845 daguerreotype by William Henry Fox Talbot showing peaches and a pineapple.[3] For a long time, food photographs tended to be shot and composed in a manner similar to the way people were used to encountering their food: laid out on a table setting and shot from an overhead perspective, i.e., from the point of view of the eater.[4] Stylists accordingly arranged the food to appear good from above, with the items arranged flat on the plate and clearly separated from each other.[5]",
