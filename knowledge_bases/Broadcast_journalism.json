  "content": "Broadcast journalism is the field of news and journals which are broadcast by electronic methods instead of the older methods, such as printed newspapers and posters. It works on radio (via air, cable, and Internet), television (via air, cable, and Internet) and the World Wide Web. Such media disperse pictures (static and moving), visual text and sounds. Broadcast articles can be written as \"packages\", \"readers\", \"voice-overs\" (VO) and \"sound on tape\" (SOT). A \"sack\" is an edited set of video clips for a news story and is common on television. It is typically narrated by a reporter. It is a story with audio, video, graphics and video effects. The news anchor, or presenter, usually reads a \"lead-in\" (introduction) before the package is aired and may conclude the story with additional information, called a \"tag\". A \"reader\" is an article read without accompanying video or sound. Sometimes an \"over the shoulder digital on-screen graphic\" is added. A voice-over, or VO, is a video article narrated by the anchor.",
