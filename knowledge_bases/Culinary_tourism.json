  "content": "Culinary tourism or food tourism or gastronomy tourism is the exploration of food as the purpose of tourism.[1] It is considered a vital component of the tourism experience.[2] Dining out is common among tourists and \"food is believed to rank alongside climate, accommodation, and scenery\" in importance to tourists.[2] Culinary tourism became prominent in 2001 after Erik Wolf, president of the World Food Travel Association, wrote a white paper on the subject.[3] Culinary or food tourism is the pursuit of unique and memorable eating and drinking experiences, both near and far.[4] Culinary tourism differs from agritourism in that culinary tourism is considered a subset of cultural tourism (cuisine is a manifestation of culture) whereas agritourism is considered a subset of rural tourism,[5] but culinary tourism and agritourism are inextricably linked, as the seeds of cuisine can be found in agriculture. Culinary/food tourism is not limited to gourmet food.[6] Food tourism can be considered a subcategory of experiential travel.[citation needed]",
