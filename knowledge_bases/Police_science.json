  "content": "Police science or police studies is the study of police work. It is a subfield of criminology and sociology.[1][2] As an interdisciplinary science, the field includes contributions from political science,[3] forensic science, anthropology, psychology, jurisprudence, criminal justice, human geography,[4] correctional administration and penology. The field makes contributions to understanding of community policing, police culture, and other policing tactics or behaviors. There was a \"dizzying expansion\" of police studies in the early 2000s with a large number of works being published in the field.[1] UK has developed the Police National Computer as a sophisticated intelligence tool that holds extensive data on criminals, vehicles and property, and accessible in a matter of seconds through over 30,000 terminals across the country. PITO reports that a national fingerprint and DNA database has been developed containing over 3.4 million DNA profiles providing the police with an average of 3,000 matches a month. In 2004-5 there were over 40,000 matches.",
