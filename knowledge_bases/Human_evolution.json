  "content": "Homo sapiens is a distinct species of the hominid family of primates, which also includes all the great apes.[1] Over their evolutionary history, humans gradually developed traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language,[2] as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily),[3] indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike.[4][5][6][7] The study of the origins of humans involves several scientific disciplines, including physical and evolutionary anthropology, paleontology, and genetics; the field is also known by the terms anthropogeny, anthropogenesis, and anthropogony[8][9]\u2014with the latter two sometimes used to refer to the related subject of hominization. Primates diverged from other mammals about 85 million years ago (mya), in the Late Cretaceous period, with their earliest fossils appearing over 55 mya, during the Paleocene.[10] Primates produced successive clades leading to the ape superfamily, which gave rise to the hominid and the gibbon families; these diverged some 15\u201320 mya. African and Asian hominids (including orangutans) diverged about 14 mya. Hominins (including the Australopithecine and Panina subtribes) parted from the Gorillini tribe between 8 and 9 mya; Australopithecine (including the extinct biped ancestors of humans) separated from the Pan genus (containing chimpanzees and bonobos) 4\u20137 mya.[11] The Homo genus is evidenced by the appearance of H. habilis over 2 mya,[a] while anatomically modern humans emerged in Africa approximately 300,000 years ago.",
