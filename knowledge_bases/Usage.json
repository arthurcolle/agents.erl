  "content": "The usage of a language is the ways in which its written and spoken variations are routinely employed by its speakers; that is, it refers to \"the collective habits of a language's native speakers\",[1] as opposed to idealized models of how a language works (or should work) in the abstract. For instance, Fowler characterized usage as \"the way in which a word or phrase is normally and correctly used\" and as the \"points of grammar, syntax, style, and the choice of words.\"[2] In everyday usage, language is used differently, depending on the situation and individual.[3] Individual language users can shape language structures and language usage based on their community.[4] In the descriptive tradition of language analysis, by way of contrast, \"correct\" tends to mean functionally adequate for the purposes of the speaker or writer using it, and adequately idiomatic to be accepted by the listener or reader; usage is also, however, a concern for the prescriptive tradition, for which \"correctness\" is a matter of arbitrating style.[5][6]",
