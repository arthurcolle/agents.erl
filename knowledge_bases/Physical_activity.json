  "name": "Physical activity",
  "content": "Physical activity is defined as any voluntary bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure.[1] Physical activity encompasses all activities, at any intensity, performed during any time of day or night.[2] It includes both voluntary exercise and incidental activity integrated into the daily routine.[3] This integrated activity may not be planned, structured, repetitive or purposeful for the improvement of physical fitness, and may include activities such as walking to the local shop, cleaning, working, active transport etc. Lack of physical activity is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, whereas increased physical activity can improve physical and mental health, as well as cognitive and cardiovascular health.[4] There are at least eight investments that work to increase population-level physical activity, including whole-of-school programmes, active transport, active urban design, healthcare, public education and mass media, sport for all, workplaces and community-wide programmes.[5][6] Physical activity increases energy expenditure and is a key regulator in controlling body weight (see Summermatter cycle for more).[7] In human beings, differences among individuals in the amount of physical activity have a substantial genetic basis.[8]",
