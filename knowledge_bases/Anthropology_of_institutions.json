  "content": "The anthropology of institutions is a sub-field in social anthropology dedicated to the study of institutions in different cultural contexts. The role of anthropology in institutions has expanded significantly since the end of the 20th century.[1] Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of globalization in both institutions and the field of anthropology.[1] Anthropologists can be employed by institutions such as for-profit business, nonprofit organizations, and governments.[1] For instance, cultural anthropologists are commonly employed by the United States federal government.[1] The two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are total institutions and social institutions.[2] Total institutions are places that comprehensively coordinate the actions of people within them, and examples of total institutions include prisons, convents, and hospitals.[2] Social institutions, on the other hand, are constructs that regulate individuals\u2019 day-to-day lives, such as kinship, religion, and economics.[2] Anthropology of institutions may analyze labor unions, businesses ranging from small enterprises to corporations, government, medical organizations,[1] education,[3] prisons,[4][5] and financial institutions.[6] Nongovernmental organizations have garnered particular interest in the field of institutional anthropology because they are capable of fulfilling roles previously ignored by governments,[7] or previously realized by families or local groups, in an attempt to mitigate social problems.[1]",
