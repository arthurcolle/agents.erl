  "content": "The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to physics: Physics \u2013 natural science that involves the study of matter[1] and its motion through spacetime, along with related concepts such as energy and force.[2] More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.[3][4][5] Physics can be described as all of the following: History of physics \u2013 history of the physical science that studies matter and its motion through space-time, and related concepts such as energy and force Physics \u2013 branch of science that studies matter[9] and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.[10] Physics is one of the \"fundamental sciences\" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:",
