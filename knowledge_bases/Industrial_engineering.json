  "content": "Industrial engineering (IE) is concerned with the design, improvement and installation of integrated systems of people, materials, information, equipment and energy. It draws upon specialized knowledge and skill in the mathematical, physical, and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems.[1] Several industrial engineering principles are followed in the manufacturing industry to ensure the effective flow of systems, processes, and operations.[2] These include: These principles allow the creation of new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of labor, materials and machines and also improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social.[3][4] Depending on the subspecialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, operations research, systems engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, supply chain engineering, management science, engineering management, financial engineering, ergonomics or human factors engineering, safety engineering, logistics engineering, quality engineering or other related capabilities or fields.",
