  "content": "Religion in Africa (2020 estimate)[1] Religion in Africa is multifaceted and has been a major influence on art, culture and philosophy. Today, the continent's various populations and individuals are mostly adherents of Christianity, Islam, and to a lesser extent several traditional African religions.[2] In Christian or Islamic communities, religious beliefs are also sometimes characterized with syncretism with the beliefs and practices of traditional religions.[3][4][5] Africa encompasses a wide variety of traditional beliefs.[6] Although religious customs are sometimes shared by many local societies, they are usually unique to specific populations or geographic regions.[7] All traditional African religions are united by a shared animistic core with special importance to ancestor worship.[8] According to Dr J Omosade Awolalu, The \"olden\" in this context means indigenous, that which is foundational, handed down from generation to generation, meant as to be upheld and practised today and forevermore. A heritage from the past, yet not treated as a thing of the past but that which connects the past with the present and the present with eternity.[5]",
