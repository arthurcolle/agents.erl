  "content": "A magazine is a periodical publication, print or digital, generally produced on a regular schedule, that contains any of a variety of subject-oriented textual and visual content forms. Magazines are generally financed by advertising, purchase price, prepaid subscriptions, or by a combination of the three. They are categorised by their frequency of publication (i.e., as weeklies, monthlies, quarterlies, etc.), their target audiences (e.g., women's and trade magazines), their subjects of focus (e.g., popular science and religious), and their tones or approach (e.g., works of satire or humor). Appearance on the cover of print magazines has historically been understood to convey a place of honor or distinction to an individual or event.[not verified in body] The etymology of the word \"magazine\" suggests derivation from the Arabic makh\u0101zin (\u0645\u062e\u0627\u0632\u0646), the broken plural of makhzan (\u0645\u062e\u0632\u0646) meaning \"depot, storehouse\" (originally military storehouse); that comes to English via Middle French magasin and Italian magazzino.[1] In its original sense, the word \"magazine\" referred to a storage space or device.[1]",
