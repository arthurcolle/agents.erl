  "content": "Forensic geology is the study of evidence relating to materials found in the Earth used to answer questions raised by the legal system. In 1975, Ray Murray and fellow Rutgers University professor John Tedrow published Forensic Geology.[1] The main use of forensic geology as it is applied today is regarding trace evidence. By examining the soil and sediment particles forensic geologists can potentially link a suspect to a particular crime or a particular crime scene. Forensic geologists work with many other disciplines of science such as medicine, biology, geography, and engineering amongst others.[2] In 2008, Alastair Ruffell and Jennifer McKinley, both of Queen's University Belfast, published Geoforensics[3] a book that focuses more on the use of geomorphology and geophysics for searches. In 2010, forensic soil scientist Lorna Dawson of the James Hutton Institute co-edited and contributed chapters to the textbook Criminal and Environmental Soil Forensics.[4] In 2012, Elisa Bergslien, at SUNY Buffalo State, published a general textbook on the topic, An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience.[5]",
