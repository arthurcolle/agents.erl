  "content": "Gemology or gemmology is the science dealing with natural and artificial gemstone materials. It is a specific interdisciplinary branch of mineralogy. Some jewelers (and many non-jewelers) are academically trained gemologists and are qualified to identify and evaluate gems.[1][2] Rudimentary education in gemology for jewellers and gemologists began in the nineteenth century, but the first qualifications were instigated after the National Association of Goldsmiths of Great Britain (NAG) set up[3] as an Education Committee for this purpose in 1908. The committee emerged as a distinct branch of NAG (named the Gemmological Association) in 1931, shortly after the incorporation of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).[4][5] In 1938 the branch was renamed as the Gemmological Association of Great Britain, before being incorporated in 1847.[4] The organisation is now an educational charity and accredited awarding body with its courses taught worldwide. The first US graduate of Gem-A's diploma course, in 1929, was Robert Shipley, who then established both the Gemological Institute of America and the American Gem Society. There are now several professional schools and associations of gemologists and certification programs around the world.",
