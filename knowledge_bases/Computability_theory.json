  "name": "Computability theory",
  "content": "Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, computer science, and the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, computability theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory. Basic questions addressed by computability theory include: Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematical computability theorists study the theory of relative computability, reducibility notions, and degree structures; those in the computer science field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages. The study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics.[a] Computability theory originated in the 1930s, with the work of Kurt G\u00f6del, Alonzo Church, R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, and Emil Post.[3][b]",
