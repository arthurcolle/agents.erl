  "content": "Zooarchaeology or archaeozoology merges the disciplines of zoology and archaeology, focusing on the analysis of animal remains within archaeological sites. This field, managed by specialists known as zooarchaeologists or faunal analysts, examines remnants such as bones, shells, hair, chitin, scales, hides, and proteins, such as DNA, to derive insights into historical human-animal interactions and environmental conditions.[1] While bones and shells tend to be relatively more preserved in archaeological contexts, the survival of faunal remains is generally infrequent.[2] The degradation or fragmentation of faunal remains presents challenges in the accurate analysis and interpretation of data.[2] Characterized by its interdisciplinary nature, zooarchaeology bridges the studies of ancient human societies and the animal kingdom.[3] Practitioners, from various scientific backgrounds including anthropology, paleontology, and ecology, aim primarily to identify and understand human interactions with animals and their environments.[4] Through the analysis of faunal remains, zooarchaeologists can gain insight into past diets, domestication practices, tool usage, and ritualistic behaviors, thus contributing to a comprehensive view of human-environment interactions and the sub-field of environmental archaeology.",
