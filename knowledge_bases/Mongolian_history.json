  "content": "Various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu (3rd century BC\u20131st century AD), the Xianbei state (c. AD 93\u2013234), the Rouran Khaganate (330\u2013555), the First (552\u2013603) and Second Turkic Khaganates (682\u2013744) and others, ruled the area of present-day Mongolia. The Khitan people, who used a para-Mongolic language,[1] founded an empire known as the Liao dynasty (916\u20131125), and ruled Mongolia and portions of North China, northern Korea, and the present-day Russian Far East. In 1206, Genghis Khan was able to unite the Mongol tribes, forging them into a fighting force which went on to establish the largest contiguous empire in world history, the Mongol Empire (1206\u20131368). After the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire, Mongolia came to be ruled by the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368) based in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) and administered as part of the Lingbei Province. Buddhism in Mongolia began with the Yuan emperors' conversion to and dissemination of Tibetan Buddhism. After collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Yuan court retreated to the Mongolian Plateau, marking the start of the Northern Yuan dynasty (1368\u20131635). The Mongols returned to their earlier patterns of internal strife and their old shamanist ways after the collapse of Yuan dynasty. Buddhism reemerged in Mongolia in the 16th and 17th centuries.",
