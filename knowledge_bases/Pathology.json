  "content": "Pathology is the study of disease.[1] The word pathology also refers to the study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of biology research fields and medical practices. However, when used in the context of modern medical treatment, the term is often used in a narrower fashion to refer to processes and tests that fall within the contemporary medical field of \"general pathology\", an area that includes a number of distinct but inter-related medical specialties that diagnose disease, mostly through analysis of tissue and human cell samples. Idiomatically, \"a pathology\" may also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases (as in the statement \"the many different forms of cancer have diverse pathologies\", in which case a more proper choice of word would be \"pathophysiologies\"). The suffix pathy is sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment (as in cardiomyopathy) and psychological conditions (such as psychopathy).[2] A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist.",
