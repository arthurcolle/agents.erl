  "content": "Landscape history is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment \u2013 both present and past. It is sometimes referred to as landscape archaeology. It was first recognised as a separate area of study during the 20th century and uses evidence and approaches from other disciplines including archaeology, architecture, ecology, aerial photography, rephotography, local history and historical geography. In England, landscape history emerged as an academic discipline following the publication of The Making of the English Landscape by W. G. Hoskins in 1955, although some topics that are now considered part of landscape history had been identified earlier. Darby,[1] for example, gives many early examples of regional characterisation of landscapes. Following Hoskins, landscape history expanded in various directions. There are published landscape histories of a number of English counties.[2] Other authors have studied the landscape at earlier periods.[3] One productive avenue has been the study of specific landscape features such as fields, villages, and so on.[4] Managed woodland has been extensively studied by Oliver Rackham.[5]",
