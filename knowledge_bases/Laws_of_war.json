  "name": "Laws of war",
  "content": "The law of war is a component of international law that regulates the conditions for initiating war (jus ad bellum) and the conduct of hostilities (jus in bello). Laws of war define sovereignty and nationhood, states and territories, occupation, and other critical terms of law. Among other issues, modern laws of war address the declarations of war, acceptance of surrender and the treatment of prisoners of war, military necessity, along with distinction and proportionality; and the prohibition of certain weapons that may cause unnecessary suffering.[1][2] The law of war is considered distinct from other bodies of law\u2014such as the domestic law of a particular belligerent to a conflict\u2014which may provide additional legal limits to the conduct or justification of war. The first traces of a law of war come from the Babylonians. It is the Code of Hammurabi,[3] king of Babylon, which in 1750 B.C., explains its laws imposing a code of conduct in the event of war: I prescribe these laws so that the strong do not oppress the weak.",
