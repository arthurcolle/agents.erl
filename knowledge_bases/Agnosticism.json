  "name": "Agnosticism",
  "content": "Agnosticism is the view or belief that the existence of God, the divine, or the supernatural is either unknowable in principle or unknown in fact.[1][2][3] It can also mean an apathy towards such religious belief and refer to personal limitations rather than a worldview.[2][4][5] Another definition is the view that \"human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\"[6] The English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley said that he originally coined the word agnostic in 1869 \"to denote people who, like [himself], confess themselves to be hopelessly ignorant concerning a variety of matters [including the matter of God's existence], about which metaphysicians and theologians, both orthodox and heterodox, dogmatise with the utmost confidence.\"[5] Earlier thinkers had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as Sanjaya Belatthiputta, a 5th-century BCE Indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife;[7][8][9] and Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of \"the gods\".[10][11][12]",
