  "content": "Second-order cybernetics, also known as the cybernetics of cybernetics, is the recursive application of cybernetics to itself and the reflexive practice of cybernetics according to such a critique. It is cybernetics where \"the role of the observer is appreciated and acknowledged rather than disguised, as had become traditional in western science\".[1] Second-order cybernetics was developed between the late 1960s and mid 1970s[note 1] by Heinz von Foerster and others, with key inspiration coming from Margaret Mead. Foerster referred to it as \"the control of control and the communication of communication\" and differentiated first-order cybernetics as \"the cybernetics of observed systems\" and second-order cybernetics as \"the cybernetics of observing systems\".[4] The concept of second-order cybernetics is closely allied to radical constructivism, which was developed around the same time by Ernst von Glasersfeld.[5] While it is sometimes considered a break from the earlier concerns of cybernetics, there is much continuity with previous work and it can be thought of as a distinct tradition within cybernetics, with origins in issues evident during the Macy conferences in which cybernetics was initially developed.[6][7][8] Its concerns include autonomy, epistemology, ethics, language, reflexivity, self-consistency, self-referentiality, and self-organizing capabilities of complex systems. It has been characterised as cybernetics where \"circularity is taken seriously\".[9]",
