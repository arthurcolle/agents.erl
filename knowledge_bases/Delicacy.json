  "content": "A delicacy is a rare food item that is considered highly desirable, sophisticated, or peculiarly distinctive within a given culture or region. A delicacy may have an unusual flavor or be expensive compared to everyday foods. Delicacies vary across countries, customs, and ages. Some delicacies are confined to a certain culture, such as fugu in Japan and ant larvae (escamoles) in Mexico, or may refer to specific local products, such as porcino, venison or anchovy. Culture plays a role in determining what is considered a delicacy. The long-standing tradition and practice of insect consumption represented in Oaxaca, Mexico has occurred for centuries.[1] The availability of foods or particular ingredients may determine the types of delicacies associated with different cultures.",
