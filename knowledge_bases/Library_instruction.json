  "content": "Library instruction, also called bibliographic instruction, user education and library orientation, is the process where librarians teach their patrons how to access information in libraries. It often involves instruction about research and organizational tools and methods.[1] It prepares individuals to make immediate and lifelong use of information effectively by teaching the concepts and logic of information access and evaluation, and by fostering information independence and critical thinking. Above all they are aimed at equipping library users with skills to locate library sources and use them effectively to satisfy their information needs. Library instruction began in the nineteenth century in the United States.[2] In 1880, Justin Winsor, president of the American Library Association (ALA), redefined the role of the librarian as also a teacher.[3] In a 1912 ALA survey, 57% of respondents offered required or elective library instruction courses.[4] There was little academic interest in the subject until the 1960s and early 1970s, when interest blossomed.[5] During this time, library instruction had solidified into a system where librarians would teach their patrons not only how to locate information in a physical library, but how to interact with the material, how to learn it, and how to apply those skills to their everyday lives. [6] The newfound rise in the popularity of library sciences precipitated the creation of the Library Orientation Exchange (LOEX), \"a non-profit, self-supporting educational clearinghouse\". With its collection of print and digital materials, the organization had over 650 members in North America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in 1999.[5]",
