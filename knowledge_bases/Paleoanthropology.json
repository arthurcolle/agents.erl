  "content": "Paleoanthropology or paleo-anthropology is a branch of paleontology and anthropology which seeks to understand the early development of anatomically modern humans, a process known as hominization, through the reconstruction of evolutionary kinship lines within the family Hominidae, working from biological evidence (such as petrified skeletal remains, bone fragments, footprints) and cultural evidence (such as stone tools, artifacts, and settlement localities).[1][2] The field draws from and combines primatology, paleontology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. As technologies and methods advance, genetics plays an ever-increasing role, in particular to examine and compare DNA structure as a vital tool of research of the evolutionary kinship lines of related species and genera. The term paleoanthropology derives from Greek palai\u00f3s (\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2) \"old, ancient\", \u00e1nthr\u014dpos (\u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2) \"man, human\" and the suffix -log\u00eda (-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1) \"study of\". Hominoids are a primate superfamily, the hominid family is currently considered to comprise both the great ape lineages and human lineages within the hominoid superfamily. The \"Homininae\" comprise both the human lineages and the African ape lineages. The term \"African apes\" refers only to chimpanzees and gorillas.[3] The terminology of the immediate biological family is currently in flux. The term \"hominin\" refers to any genus in the human tribe (Hominini), of which Homo sapiens (modern humans) is the only living specimen.[4][5]",
