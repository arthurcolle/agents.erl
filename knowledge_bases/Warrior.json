  "content": "A warrior is a guardian specializing in combat or warfare, especially within the context of a tribal or clan-based warrior culture society that recognizes a separate warrior aristocracy, class, or caste. Warriors seem to have been present in the earliest pre-state societies.[1] Scholars have argued that horse-riding Yamnaya warriors from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe played a key role during the Indo-European migrations and the diffusion of Indo-European languages across Eurasia.[2][3] Most of the basic weapons used by warriors appeared before the rise of most hierarchical systems. Bows and arrows, clubs, spears, swords, and other edged weapons were in widespread use. However, with the new findings of metallurgy, the aforementioned weapons had grown in effectiveness.[4] When the first hierarchical systems evolved 5000 years ago, the gap between the rulers and the ruled had increased. Making war to extend the outreach of their territories, rulers often forced men from lower orders of society into the military role. That had been the first use of professional soldiers, a distinct difference from the warrior communities.[5]",
