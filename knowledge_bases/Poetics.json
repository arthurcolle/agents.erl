  "name": "Poetics",
  "content": "Poetics is the study or theory of poetry, specifically the study or theory of device, structure, form, type, and effect with regards to poetry,[1] though usage of the term can also refer to literature broadly.[2][3] Poetics is distinguished from hermeneutics by its focus on the synthesis of non-semantic elements in a text rather than its semantic interpretation.[4] Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading. Generally speaking, poetics in the western tradition emerged out of Ancient Greece. Fragments of Homer and Hesiod represent the earliest Western treatments of poetic theory, followed later by the work of the lyricist Pindar.[5] The term poetics derives from the Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 poietikos \"pertaining to poetry\"; also \"creative\" and \"productive\".[6] It stems, not surprisingly, from the word for poetry, \"poiesis\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) meaning \"the activity in which a person brings something into being that did not exist before.\" \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 itself derives from the Doric word \"poiw\u00e9\u014d\" (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ad\u03c9) which translates, simply, as \"to make.\"[7] In the Western world, the development and evolution of poetics featured three artistic movements concerned with poetical composition: (i) the formalist, (2) the objectivist, and (iii) the Aristotelian.[8]",
