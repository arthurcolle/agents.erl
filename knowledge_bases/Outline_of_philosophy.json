  "content": "Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.[1][2] It is distinguished from other ways of addressing fundamental questions (such as mysticism, myth) by being critical and generally systematic and by its reliance on rational argument.[3] It involves logical analysis of language and clarification of the meaning of words and concepts. The word \"philosophy\" comes from the Greek philosophia (\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1), which literally means \"love of wisdom\".[4][5][6] The branches of philosophy and their sub-branches that are used in contemporary philosophy are as follows. Aesthetics is study of the nature of beauty, art, and taste, and the creation of personal kinds of truth. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies the source, nature and validity of knowledge. Ethics \u2013 study of value and morality. Logic \u2013 the systematic study of the form of valid inference and reasoning. Also regarded as the separate formal science.",
