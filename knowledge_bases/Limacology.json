  "content": "Limacology (from Latin limax, \"slug\", and Greek -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia) is the branch of zoology which deals with slugs, i.e. shell-less gastropod mollusks. A person that studies limacology is referred to as a limacologist. However, slugs are an extremely polyphyletic group, thus \"limacology\" is not a taxonomically accurate term, and it is now rarely used. This gastropod-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
