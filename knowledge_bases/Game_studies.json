  "content": "Game studies, also known as ludology (from ludus, \"game\", and -logia, \"study\", \"research\") or gaming theory, is the study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a field of cultural studies that deals with all types of games throughout history. This field of research utilizes the tactics of, at least, folkloristics and cultural heritage, sociology and psychology, while examining aspects of the design of the game, the players in the game, and the role the game plays in its society or culture. Game studies is oftentimes confused with the study of video games, but this is only one area of focus; in reality game studies encompasses all types of gaming, including sports, board games, etc. Before video games, game studies was rooted primarily in anthropology.[1] However, with the development and spread of video games, games studies has diversified methodologically, to include approaches from sociology, psychology, and other fields.[2] There are now a number of strands within game studies: \"social science\" approaches explore how games function in society, and their interactions with human psychology, often using empirical methods such as surveys and controlled lab experiments. \"Humanities-based\" approaches emphasise how games generate meanings and reflect or subvert wider social and cultural discourses. These often use more interpretative methods, such as close reading, textual analysis, and audience theory, methods shared with other media disciplines such as television and film studies. Social sciences and humanities approaches can cross over, for example in the case of ethnographic or folkloristic studies, where fieldwork may involve patiently observing games to try to understand their social and cultural meanings. \"Game design\" approaches are closely related to creative practice, analysing game mechanics and aesthetics in order to inform the development of new games. Finally, \"industrial\" and \"engineering\" approaches apply mostly to video games and less to games in general, and examine things such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and networking.[3]",
