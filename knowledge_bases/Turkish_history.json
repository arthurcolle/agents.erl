  "content": "The history of Turkey, understood as the history of the area now forming the territory of the Republic of Turkey, includes the history of both Anatolia (the Asian part of Turkey) and Eastern Thrace (the European part of Turkey). These two previously politically distinct regions came under control of the Roman Empire in the second century BC, eventually becoming the core of the Roman Byzantine Empire. For times predating the Ottoman period, a distinction should also be made between the history of the Turkic peoples, and the history of the territories now forming the Republic of Turkey[1][2] From the time when parts of what is now Turkey were conquered by the Seljuq dynasty, the history of Turkey spans the medieval history of the Seljuk Empire, the medieval to modern history of the Ottoman Empire, and the history of the Republic of Turkey since the 1920s.[1][2] Present-day Turkey has been inhabited by modern humans since the late Paleolithic period and contains some of the world's oldest Neolithic sites.[3][4] G\u00f6bekli Tepe is close to 12,000 years old.[3] Parts of Anatolia include the Fertile Crescent, an origin of agriculture.[5] Other important Anatolian Neolithic sites include \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck and Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck.[6] Neolithic Anatolian farmers differed genetically from farmers in Iran and Jordan Valley.[7] These early Anatolian farmers also migrated into Europe, starting around 9,000 years ago.[8][9][10] Troy's earliest layers go back to around 4500 BC.[6] The Urfa Man statue is dated c. 9000 BC, to the period of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, and is defined as \"the oldest known naturalistic life-sized sculpture of a human\".[11]",
