  "content": "Land management is the process of managing the use and development of land resources. Those resources are used for a variety of purposes for example agriculture, forestry, water resource management, human settlements and tourism. One aim of land management is to prevent or reverse land degradation. Another aim is to ensure water security by increasing soil moisture availability, decreasing surface runoff, and decreasing soil erosion.[1] Unsustainable land managements leads to land being over- or misused which in turn degrades the land, reduces productivity and disrupts natural equilibriums.[2] Sustainable land management (SLM) is the set of practices and technologies that aim to integrate the management of land, water, and other environmental resources to meet human needs while ensuring long-term sustainability, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and livelihoods.[3]: 2924 Sustainable forest management is a sub-category of sustainable land management.[4]: 23 The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report describes land management as \"The sum of land-use practices (e.g., sowing, fertilising, weeding, harvesting, thinning and clear-cutting) that take place within broader land-use categories.\"[3]: 2914 Land use itself is \"The total of arrangements, activities and inputs applied to a parcel of land.\" Land use categories include: forest land, cropland (agricultural land), grassland, wetlands, settlements and other lands.[3]: 2914",
