  "content": "Urban studies is based on the study of the urban development of cities and regions\u2014it makes up the theory portion of the field of urban planning. This includes studying the history of city development from an architectural point of view, to the impact of urban design on community development efforts. [1] Urban studies is a major field of study used by practitioners of urban planning,[2][3] it helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment.[4][5] The study of cities has changed dramatically from the 1800s over time, with new frames of analysis being applied to the development of urban areas. The first college programs were created to observe how cities were developed based on anthropological research of ghetto communities.[6] In the mid-1900s, urban study programs expanded beyond just looking at the current and historical impacts of city design and began studying how those designs impacted the future interactions of people and how to improve city development through architecture, open spaces, the interactions of people, and different types of capital that forms a community.[4]",
