  "content": "The history of Argentina can be divided into four main parts: the pre-Columbian time or early history (up to the sixteenth century), the colonial period (1536\u20131809), the period of nation-building (1810\u20131880), and the history of modern Argentina (from around 1880). Prehistory in the present territory of Argentina began with the first human settlements on the southern tip of Patagonia around 13,000 years ago. Written history began with the arrival of Spanish chroniclers in the expedition of Juan D\u00edaz de Sol\u00eds in 1516 to the R\u00edo de la Plata, which marks the beginning of Spanish occupation of this region. In 1776, the Spanish Crown established the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, an umbrella of territories from which, with the Revolution of May 1810, began a process of gradual formation of several independent states, including one called the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata. With the declaration of independence on 9 July 1816, and the military defeat of the Spanish Empire in 1824, a federal state was formed in 1853\u20131861, known today as the Argentine Republic.",
