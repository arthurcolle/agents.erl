  "content": "In contemporary education, mathematics education\u2014known in Europe as the didactics or pedagogy of mathematics\u2014is the practice of teaching, learning, and carrying out scholarly research into the transfer of mathematical knowledge. Although research into mathematics education is primarily concerned with the tools, methods, and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice, it also covers an extensive field of study encompassing a variety of different concepts, theories and methods. National and international organisations regularly hold conferences and publish literature in order to improve mathematics education. Elementary mathematics were a core part of education in many ancient civilisations, including ancient Egypt, ancient Babylonia, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and Vedic India.[citation needed] In most cases, formal education was only available to male children with sufficiently high status, wealth, or caste.[citation needed] The oldest known mathematics textbook is the Rhind papyrus, dated from circa 1650 BCE.[1]",
