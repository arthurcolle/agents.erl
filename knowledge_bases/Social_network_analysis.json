Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks,[2][3] meme proliferation,[4] information circulation,[5] friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, knowledge networks,[6][7] difficult working relationships,[8] collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships.[9][10] These networks are often visualized through sociograms in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.[11]",
