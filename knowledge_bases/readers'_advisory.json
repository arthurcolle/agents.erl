  "content": "Readers' advisory (sometimes spelled readers advisory or reader's advisory) is a service which involves suggesting fiction and nonfiction titles to a reader through direct or indirect means. This service is a fundamental library service; however, readers' advisory also occurs in commercial contexts such as bookstores. Currently, almost all North American public libraries offer some form of readers' advisory.[1] \"Setting a date for the start of what we now call readers advisory service, particularly readers advisory in the public library, is at best a frustrating, almost arbitrary exercise. Efforts at historical precision can founder on such basic issues as the absence of common definitions. For example, answers to such questions as 'What exactly is a public library?\" or \"What really is readers advisory?\" have long been disputed.\" (Bill Crowley, from his 2005 journal article \"Rediscovering the History of Readers Advisory Service\")[2] The historical period divisions and merits of different types of readers' advisory services is a hotly debated topic among librarians.",
