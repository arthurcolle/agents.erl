  "content": "Empirical methods Prescriptive and policy The economy of governments covers the systems for setting levels of taxation, government budgets, the money supply and interest rates as well as the labour market, national ownership, and many other areas of government interventions into the economy. Most factors of economic policy can be divided into either fiscal policy, which deals with government actions regarding taxation and spending, or monetary policy, which deals with central banking actions regarding the money supply and interest rates. Such policies are often influenced by international institutions like the International Monetary Fund or World Bank as well as political beliefs and the consequent policies of parties. Almost every aspect of government has an important economic component. A few examples of the kinds of economic policies that exist include:[1] Stabilization policy attempts to stimulate an economy out of recession or constrain the money supply to prevent excessive inflation.",
