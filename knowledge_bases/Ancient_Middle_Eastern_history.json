  "content": "Mesopotamia Egypt Iran Anatolia The Levant Arabia Cosmology The ancient Near East was home to many cradles of civilization, spanning Mesopotamia,[1][a] Egypt, Iran (or Persia),[b] Anatolia and the Armenian highlands,[2][c] the Levant,[d] and the Arabian Peninsula.[e] As such, the fields of ancient Near East studies and Near Eastern archaeology are one of the most prominent with regard to research in the realm of ancient history. Historically, the Near East denoted an area roughly encompassing the centre of West Asia, having been focused on the lands between Greece and Egypt in the west and Iran in the east. It therefore largely corresponds with the modern-day geopolitical concept of the Middle East. The history of the ancient Near East begins with the rise of Sumer in the 4th millennium BC, though the date that it ends is a subject of debate among scholars; the term covers the region's developments in the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, and is variously considered to end with either the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC, the establishment of the Macedonian Empire in the 4th century BC, or the beginning of the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century AD.",
