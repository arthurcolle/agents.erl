  "content": "The following outline is provided as an overview of, and topical guide to, theology. Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine. It is taught as an academic discipline, typically in universities, seminaries and schools of divinity. Apologetics is the whole of the consensus of the views of those who defend a position in an argument of long standing. Divine presence Eschatology, literally the \"study of the last\", is the part of theology and philosophy concerned with the end of the world. Theism in the broadest sense is the belief in the existence of a god or gods. In the more specific sense used here theism refers to a particular doctrine concerning the nature of a God and its relationship to the universe.",
