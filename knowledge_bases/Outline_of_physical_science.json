  "content": "Physical science is a branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to life science. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a \"physical science\", together is called the \"physical sciences\". Physical science can be described as all of the following: History of physical science \u2013 history of the branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a \"physical science\", together called the \"physical sciences\". However, the term \"physical\" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena (organic chemistry, for example). The four main branches of physical science are astronomy, physics, chemistry, and the Earth sciences, which include meteorology and geology. There are also a number of others which have become important in the twenty-first such as materials science and computer science. Physics \u2013 branch of science that studies matter[4] and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.[5] Physics is one of the \"fundamental sciences\" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology, etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms, or subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:",
