The term \u02bfi\u1e07r\u00ee\u1e6f 'Hebrew' was not used for the language in the Hebrew Bible, which was referred to as \u05e9\u05b0\u05b9\u05e4\u05b7\u05ea \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b7\u05e2\u05b7\u05df\u200e \u015b\u0259p\u0304a\u1e6f k\u0259na\u02bfan 'language of Canaan' or \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u200e Y\u0259h\u00fb\u1e0f\u00ee\u1e6f 'Judean', but it was used in Koine Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts.[1] The Hebrew language is attested in inscriptions from about the 10th century BCE,[2][3] when it was almost identical to Phoenician and other Canaanite languages, and spoken Hebrew persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in 70 CE with the siege of Jerusalem. It eventually developed into Mishnaic Hebrew, which was spoken until the 5th century.",
