  "content": "Aftertaste is the taste intensity of a food or beverage that is perceived immediately after that food or beverage is removed from the mouth.[1] The aftertastes of different foods and beverages can vary by intensity and over time, but the unifying feature of aftertaste is that it is perceived after a food or beverage is either swallowed or spat out. The neurobiological mechanisms of taste (and aftertaste) signal transduction from the taste receptors in the mouth to the brain have not yet been fully understood. However, the primary taste processing area located in the insula has been observed to be involved in aftertaste perception.[2] Characteristics of a food's aftertaste are quality, intensity, and duration.[1] Quality describes the actual taste of a food and intensity conveys the magnitude of that taste. Duration describes how long a food's aftertaste sensation lasts. Foods that have lingering aftertastes typically have long sensation durations. Because taste perception is unique to every person, descriptors for taste quality and intensity have been standardized, particularly for use in scientific studies.[3] For taste quality, foods can be described by the commonly used terms \"sweet\", \"sour\", \"salty\", \"bitter\", \"umami\", or \"no taste\". Description of aftertaste perception relies heavily upon the use of these words to convey the taste that is being sensed after a food has been removed from the mouth.",
