  "content": "Cheondoism (spelled Chondoism in North Korea;[1] Korean: \ucc9c\ub3c4\uad50; lit. Religion of the Celestial Way) is a 20th-century Korean pantheistic religion, based on the 19th-century Donghak religious movement founded by Choe Je-u and codified under Son Byong-hi.[2] Cheondoism has its origins in the peasant rebellions which arose starting in 1812 during the Joseon. Cheondoism incorporates elements of Korean shamanism.[3] It places emphasis on personal cultivation and social welfare in the present world.[2] Splinter movements include Suwunism and Bocheonism.[4] Cheondogyo translated literally means \"religion of the Celestial Way\", where cheon means \"sky\", do means \"way\" (written with the same character as Chinese Tao), and gyo means \"religion\", \"teaching\", \"-ism\". Over time, Cheondoism has also adapted elements of other Korean religious traditions, including Do (Taoism) and Buddhism.[5] In keeping with its roots in Confucian thought, Cheondoism venerates Cheon (\"Sky\" or \"Heaven\") as the ultimate principle of good and justice, which is referred to by the honorific term Haneullim (\ud558\ub298\ub2d8), or \"Divinity\". According to church doctrine, the term \"Haneul\" does not only mean \"Sky\"; it represents the whole universe or \"oneness\", as well.[6][failed verification] This title implies the quality of Heaven as \"instructor\"; a belief that humans and things are not created by a supernatural God but generated by a God-nature present in all living and unliving things.[7][need quotation to verify]",
