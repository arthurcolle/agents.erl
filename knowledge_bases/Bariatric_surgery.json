  "content": "Bariatric surgery (also known as metabolic surgery or weight loss surgery) is a surgical procedure used to manage obesity and obesity-related conditions.[1][2] Long term weight loss with bariatric surgery may be achieved through alteration of gut hormones, physical reduction of stomach size (stomach reduction surgery),[3] reduction of nutrient absorption, or a combination of these.[2][4] Standard of care procedures include Roux en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, from which weight loss is largely achieved by altering gut hormone levels responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to a new hormonal weight set point.[4] In morbidly obese people, bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for weight loss and reducing complications.[5][6][7][8][9] A 2021 meta-analysis found that bariatric surgery was associated with reduction in all-cause mortality among obese adults with or without type 2 diabetes.[10] This meta-analysis also found that median life-expectancy was 9.3 years longer for obese adults with diabetes who received bariatric surgery as compared to routine (non-surgical) care, whereas the life expectancy gain was 5.1 years longer for obese adults without diabetes.[10] The risk of death in the period following surgery is less than 1 in 1,000.[11] A 2016 review estimated bariatric surgery could reduce all-cause mortality by 30-50% in obese people.[1] Bariatric surgery may also lower disease risk, including improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors, fatty liver disease, and diabetes management.[12]",
