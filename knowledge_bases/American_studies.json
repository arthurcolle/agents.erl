  "content": "American studies or American civilization is an interdisciplinary field of scholarship that examines American literature, history, society, and culture.[1] It traditionally incorporates American historiography, literary criticism, and critical theory. Scholarship in American studies focuses on the United States. In the past decades, however, it has also broadened to include Atlantic history and interactions with countries across the globe.[2] Subjects studied within the field are varied, but often examine the literary themes, histories of American communities, ideologies, or cultural productions. Examples might include topics in American social movements, literature, media, tourism, folklore, and intellectual history. Fields studying specific American ethnic or racial groups are considered to be both independent of and included within the broader American studies discipline. This includes African American studies, Asian American studies, Colonial studies, European American studies, Latino studies, Native American studies, and others.",
