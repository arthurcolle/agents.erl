Along with fuel, and munitions in general, the steady supply of ordnance is an ongoing logistical challenge in active combat zones. Materiel management consists of continuing actions relating to planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, controlling, and evaluating the application of resources to ensure the effective and economical support of military forces. It includes provisioning, cataloging, requirements determination, acquisition, distribution, maintenance, and disposal. The terms \"materiel management\", \"materiel control\", \"inventory control\", \"inventory management\", and \"supply management\" are synonymous.[6][7]",
