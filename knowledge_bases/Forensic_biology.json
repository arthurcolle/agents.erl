  "content": "Forensic biology is the application of biological principles and techniques in the investigation of criminal and civil cases.[1][2] Forensic biology is primarily concerned with analyzing biological and serological evidence in order to obtain a DNA profile, which aids law enforcement in the identification of potential suspects or unidentified remains. This field encompasses various sub-branches, including forensic anthropology, forensic entomology, forensic odontology, forensic pathology, and forensic toxicology. The first recorded use of forensic procedures dates back to the 7th century when the concept of using fingerprints as a means of identification was first established. By the end of the 7th century, forensic procedures were being used to determine the guilt of criminals.[3][4] An early pioneer in criminal identification through biology was Alphonse Bertillon, also known as the \"father of criminal identification\".[5] In 1879, he introduced a scientific approach to personal identification by developing the science of anthropometry.[6][7][8] Anthropometry involves the use of a series of body measurements to distinguish human individuals.",
