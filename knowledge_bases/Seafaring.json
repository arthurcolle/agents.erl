  "content": "Seamanship is the art, competence, and knowledge of operating a ship, boat or other craft on water.[1] The Oxford Dictionary states that seamanship is \"The skill, techniques, or practice of handling a ship or boat at sea.\"[2] It involves topics and development of specialised skills, including navigation and international maritime law and regulatory knowledge; weather, meteorology and forecasting; watchkeeping; ship-handling and small boat handling; operation of deck equipment, anchors and cables; ropework and line handling; communications; sailing; engines; execution of evolutions such as towing; cargo handling equipment, dangerous cargoes and cargo storage; dealing with emergencies; survival at sea and search and rescue; and fire fighting. The degree of knowledge needed within these areas is dependent upon the nature of the work and the type of vessel employed by a seafarer.[3] Seamanship on a commercial level involves a knowledge of all the different ship types (such as bulk carriers, container ships, oil tankers, cruise ships, platform supply vessels, and others), including a basic knowledge of ship recognition, a basic understanding of nautical terms, ship structure and naval architecture and cargo operations, specific to the vessel the seafarer is working on.[3][4] Some ship types will have specialist cargo equipment and tools; for example, a bulk carrier may have gantry cranes or grabs for cargo or a container ship may have container lashings.[3] Cargoes should be properly stowed and secured to prevent shifting while at sea.[3] Oil tankers and gas carriers can be somewhat complex due to the hazardous nature of their cargoes, and therefore a greater degree of seamanship may be necessary for some vessel types compared to others.[3]",
