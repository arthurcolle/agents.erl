  "content": "Confucianism, also known as Ruism or Ru classicism,[1] is a system of thought and behavior originating in ancient China, and is variously described as a tradition, philosophy (humanistic or rationalistic), religion, theory of government, or way of life.[2] Confucianism developed from teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551\u2013479 BC), during a time that was later referred to as the Hundred Schools of Thought era. Confucius considered himself a transmitter of cultural values inherited from the Xia (c. 2070\u20131600 BC), Shang (c. 1600\u20131046 BC), and Western Zhou (c. 1046\u2013771 BC) dynasties.[3] Confucianism was suppressed during the Legalist and autocratic Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), but survived. During the Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD), Confucian approaches edged out the \"proto-Taoist\" Huang\u2013Lao as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism.[4] Confucianism regards principles contained in the Five Classics, the key tenets that should be followed to promote the harmony of the family and the society as a whole. A Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 AD). In the late Tang, Confucianism further developed in response to the increasing influence of Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar-official class in the Song dynasty (960\u20131297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the \"Three Principles of the People\" with the establishment of the Republic of China, and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China. In the late twentieth century, the Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy.[4]",
