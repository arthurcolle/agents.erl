  "content": "Psychoanalytic sociology is the research field that analyzes society using the same methods that psychoanalysis applies to analyze an individual.[1] 'Psychoanalytic sociology embraces work from divergent sociological traditions and political perspectives': its common 'emphasis on unconscious mental processes and behavior renders psychoanalytic sociology a controversial subfield within the broader sociological discipline'[2] (as with psychoanalysis in academic psychology). Similarly, sociatry applies psychiatry to society itself. The desire to establish a link between psychoanalysis and sociology appears very early on in Freud's work. The articles \"Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices\" (1907b) and \" 'Civilized' Sexual Morality and Modern Nervous Illness\" (1908d) are evidence of this'.[3] Though the latter article was 'the earliest of Freud's full-length discussions of the antagonism between civilization and instinctual life, his convictions on the subject went back much further': however the 'sociological aspects of that antagonism form the main subject'[4] in 1908.",
