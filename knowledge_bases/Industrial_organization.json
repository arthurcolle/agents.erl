  "content": "Empirical methods Prescriptive and policy In economics, industrial organization is a field that builds on the theory of the firm by examining the structure of (and, therefore, the boundaries between) firms and markets. Industrial organization adds real-world complications to the perfectly competitive model, complications such as transaction costs,[1] limited information, and barriers to entry of new firms that may be associated with imperfect competition. It analyzes determinants of firm and market organization and behavior on a continuum between competition[2] and monopoly,[3] including from government actions. There are different approaches to the subject. One approach is descriptive in providing an overview of industrial organization, such as measures of competition and the size-concentration of firms in an industry. A second approach uses microeconomic models to explain internal firm organization and market strategy, which includes internal research and development along with issues of internal reorganization and renewal.[4] A third aspect is oriented to public policy related to economic regulation,[5] antitrust law,[6] and, more generally, the economic governance of law in defining property rights, enforcing contracts, and providing organizational infrastructure.[7][8]",
