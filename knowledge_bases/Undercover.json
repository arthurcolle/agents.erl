  "content": "A covert operation or undercover operation is a military or police operation involving a covert agent or troops acting under an assumed cover to conceal the identity of the party responsible.[1] Under US law, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) must lead covert operations unless the president finds that another agency should do so and informs Congress.[2] The CIA's authority to conduct covert action comes from the National Security Act of 1947.[3] President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12333 titled United States Intelligence Activities in 1984. This order defined covert action as \"special activities\", both political and military, that the US Government could legally deny. The CIA was also designated as the sole authority under the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act and in Title 50 of the United States Code Section 413(e).[3][4] The CIA must have a \"Presidential Finding\" issued by the President in order to conduct these activities under the Hughes-Ryan amendment to the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act.[2] These findings are then monitored by the oversight committees in both the US Senate and House of Representatives.[5] As a result of this framework, the CIA \"receives more oversight from the Congress than any other agency in the federal government\", according to one author.[6] The Special Activities Division (SAD) is a division of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, responsible for Covert Action and \"Special Activities\". These special activities include covert political influence and paramilitary operations.",
