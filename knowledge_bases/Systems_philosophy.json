  "content": "Systems philosophy is a discipline aimed at constructing a new philosophy (in the sense of worldview) by using systems concepts. The discipline was first described by Ervin Laszlo in his 1972 book Introduction to Systems Philosophy: Toward a New Paradigm of Contemporary Thought.[1] It has been described as the \"reorientation of thought and world view ensuing from the introduction of \"systems\" as a new scientific paradigm\".[2] Soon after Laszlo founded systems philosophy it was placed in context by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, one of the founders of general system theory, when he categorized three domains within systemics namely: Systems philosophy consists of four main areas: The term \"systems philosophy\" is often used as a convenient shorthand to refer to \"the philosophy of systems\",[12] but this usage can be misleading. The philosophy of systems is in fact merely the element of systems philosophy called \"systems ontology\" by von Bertalanffy[13] and \"systems metaphysics\" by Laszlo.[14] Systems ontology provides important grounding for systems thinking but does not encompass the essential focus of systems philosophy, which is about articulating a worldview grounded in systems perspectives and humanistic concerns.[citation needed]",
