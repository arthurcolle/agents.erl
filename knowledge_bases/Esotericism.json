  "content": "Western esotericism is an academic discipline of research, scholarship, and education that focuses on the history of Western esotericism. Prior to the first academic interest in the topic of Western esotericism, Arthur Edward Waite (who was a Freemason and member of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia) had written extensively on the topic from a traditionalist, religionist, and generalist perspective. He was often cited as an authority by the early academics in the field who followed him.[1] As his biographer R. A. Gilbert described him, \"Waite's name has survived because he was the first to attempt a systematic study of the history of Western occultism\u2014viewed as a spiritual tradition rather than as aspects of protoscience or as the pathology of religion.\"[2] The more formal academic study of Western esotericism was pioneered in the early 20th century by historians of the ancient world and the European Renaissance, who came to recognise that\u2014although it had been ignored by previous scholarship\u2014the impact which pre-Christian and non-rational schools of thought had exerted on European society and culture was worthy of academic attention.[3] One of the key centres for this was the Warburg Institute in London, where scholars like Frances Yates, Edgar Wind, Ernst Cassier and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater impact on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted.[4] In 1965, the world's first academic post in the study of esotericism was established at the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes in the Sorbonne, Paris; named the chair in the History of Christian Esotericism, its first holder was Fran\u00e7ois Secret, a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah.[5] In 1979 the scholar Antoine Faivre assumed Secret's chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the \"History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe\".[6] Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field.[7]",
