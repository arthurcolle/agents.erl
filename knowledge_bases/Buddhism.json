Buddhism has subsequently played a major role in Asian culture and spirituality, eventually spreading to the West in the 20th century.[12] According to tradition, the Buddha instructed his followers in a path of development which leads to awakening and full liberation from dukkha (lit. 'suffering or unease'[note 1]). He regarded this path as a Middle Way between extremes such as asceticism or sensual indulgence.[17][18] Teaching that dukkha arises alongside attachment or clinging, the Buddha advised meditation practices and ethical precepts rooted in non-harming. Widely observed teachings include the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the doctrines of dependent origination, karma, and the three marks of existence. Other commonly observed elements include the Triple Gem, the taking of monastic vows, and the cultivation of perfections (p\u0101ramit\u0101).[19]",
