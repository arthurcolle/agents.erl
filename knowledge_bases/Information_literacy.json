  "content": "The Association of College and Research Libraries defines information literacy as a \"set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning\".[1][2][3][4] In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals' definition also makes reference to knowing both \"when\" and \"why\" information is needed.[5] The 1989 American Library Association (ALA) Presidential Committee on Information Literacy formally defined information literacy (IL) as attributes of an individual, stating that \"to be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate and use effectively the needed information\".[6][7] In 1990, academic Lori Arp published a paper asking, \"Are information literacy instruction and bibliographic instruction the same?\"[8] Arp argued that neither term was particularly well defined by theoreticians or practitioners in the field. Further studies were needed to lessen the confusion and continue to articulate the parameters of the question.[8]",
