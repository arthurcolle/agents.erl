  "content": "Moral psychology is the study of human thought and behavior in ethical contexts.[1] Historically, the term \"moral psychology\" was used relatively narrowly to refer to the study of moral development.[2][3] This field of study is interdisciplinary between the application of philosophy and psychology. Moral psychology eventually came to refer more broadly to various topics at the intersection of ethics, psychology, and philosophy of mind.[4][5][6] Some of the main topics of the field are moral judgment, moral reasoning, moral satisficing, moral sensitivity, moral responsibility, moral motivation, moral identity, moral action, moral development, moral diversity, moral character (especially as related to virtue ethics), altruism, psychological egoism, moral luck, moral forecasting, moral emotion, affective forecasting, and moral disagreement.[7][8] Today, moral psychology is a thriving area of research spanning many disciplines,[9] with major bodies of research on the biological,[10][11] cognitive/computational[12][13][14] and cultural[15][16] basis of moral judgment and behavior, and a growing body of research on moral judgment in the context of artificial intelligence.[17][18]",
