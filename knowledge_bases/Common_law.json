  "content": "Common law (also known as judicial precedent, judge-made law, or case law) is the body of law primarily developed through judicial decisions rather than statutes.[2][3] Although common law may incorporate certain statutes, it is largely based on precedent\u2014judicial rulings made in previous similar cases.[4] The presiding judge determines which precedents to apply in deciding each new case.[4] Common law is deeply rooted in stare decisis (\"to stand by things decided\"), where courts follow precedents established by previous decisions.[5] When a similar case has been resolved, courts typically align their reasoning with the precedent set in that decision.[5] However, in a \"case of first impression\" with no precedent or clear legislative guidance, judges are empowered to resolve the issue and establish new precedent.[6][7] The common law, so named because it was \"common\" to all the king's courts across England, originated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the Norman Conquest in 1066.[8][9] It established a unified legal system, gradually supplanting the local folk courts and manorial courts.[9][8] England spread the English legal system across the British Isles, first to Wales, and then to Ireland and overseas colonies; this was continued by the later British Empire. Many former colonies retain the common law system today. These common law systems are legal systems that give great weight to judicial precedent, and to the style of reasoning inherited from the English legal system.[10][11][12][13] Today, approximately one-third of the world's population lives in common law jurisdictions or in mixed legal systems that integrate common law and civil law.[14]",
