Acts of assassination have been performed since ancient times. A person who carries out an assassination is called an assassin.[4] Assassin comes from the Italian and French Assissini, believed to derive from the word hashshashin (Arabic: \u062d\u0634\u0651\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0646, romanized: \u1e25a\u0161\u0161\u0101\u0161\u012by\u012bn),[6] and shares its etymological roots with hashish (/h\u00e6\u02c8\u0283i\u02d0\u0283/ or /\u02c8h\u00e6\u0283i\u02d0\u0283/; from \u062d\u0634\u064a\u0634 \u1e25a\u0161\u012b\u0161).[7][8] It referred to a group of Nizari Ismailis known as the Order of Assassins who worked against various political targets.[9] Founded by Hassan-i Sabbah, the Assassins were active in the Near East from the 11th to the 13th centuries. The group killed members of the Abbasid, Seljuk, Fatimid, and Christian Crusader elite for political and religious reasons.[9]",
