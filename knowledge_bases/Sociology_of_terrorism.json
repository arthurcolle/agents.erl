The field studies terrorism, why it happens, and looks at its impacts on society. The sociology of terrorism draws from the fields of political science, history, economics and psychology. The sociology of terrorism differs from critical terrorism studies, emphasizing the social conditions that enable terrorism. It also studies how individuals, as well as states, respond to such events. Sociology of terrorism views terrorism as a \"social construction.\"[1] Within this field, defining terrorism involves interpreting events and determining causes. This definition process and the resulting presentation to the public can manipulate public perceptions and promote certain interests.[1] The field analyzes how people are motivated to engage in collective acts of violence for political change.[2][3] The field states that this type of violence, as a social behavior, relies on communication, shared and competing norms and values, and levels of social and self-restraints.[4] Terrorists are seen to have emerged from societies where radical norms and values proved more influential.[4] The sociological inquiry into these issues is approached on the basis of disciplinary insights in theoretical, methodological, and thematic respects.[5]",
