Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions. A common analogy called the organic or biological analogy, popularized by Herbert Spencer, presents these parts of society as human body \"organs\" that work toward the proper functioning of the \"body\" as a whole.[3] In the most basic terms, it simply emphasizes \"the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system\". For Talcott Parsons, \"structural-functionalism\" came to describe a particular stage in the methodological development of social science, rather than a specific school of thought.[4][5]",
