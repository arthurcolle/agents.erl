  "name": "Supramolecular chemistry",
  "content": "Supramolecular chemistry refers to the branch of chemistry concerning chemical systems composed of a discrete number of molecules. The strength of the forces responsible for spatial organization of the system range from weak intermolecular forces, electrostatic charge, or hydrogen bonding to strong covalent bonding, provided that the electronic coupling strength remains small relative to the energy parameters of the component.[1][2][page needed] While traditional chemistry concentrates on the covalent bond, supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible non-covalent interactions between molecules.[3] These forces include hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, pi\u2013pi interactions and electrostatic effects.[4][5] Important concepts advanced by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self-assembly, molecular folding, molecular recognition, host\u2013guest chemistry, mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures, and dynamic covalent chemistry.[6] The study of non-covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes that rely on these forces for structure and function. Biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research.",
