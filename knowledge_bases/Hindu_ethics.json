  "content": "Ethics involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.[1] A central aspect of ethics is \"the good life\", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional moral conduct.[2] Most religions have an ethical component, often derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Simon Blackburn states that there are those who \"would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition\".[3] Ethics in Buddhism are traditionally based on the enlightened perspective of the Buddha, or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in Buddhist scriptures or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.[4]",
