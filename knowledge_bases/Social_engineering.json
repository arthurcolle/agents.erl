  "content": "Social engineering is a term which has been used to mean top-down efforts to influence particular attitudes and social behaviors on a large scale\u2014most often undertaken by governments, but also carried out by mass media, academia or private groups\u2014in order to produce desired characteristics in a target population. The Dutch industrialist J.C. Van Marken (nl) used the term sociale ingenieurs (\"social engineers\") in an essay in 1894. The idea was that modern employers needed the assistance of specialists in handling the human challenges, just as they needed technical expertise (traditional engineers) to deal with non-human challenges (materials, machines, processes). \"Social engineering\" was the title of a small journal in 1899 (renamed \"Social Service\" from 1900), and in 1909 it was the title of a book by the journal's former editor, William H. Tolman (translated into French in 1910). With the Social Gospel sociologist Edwin L. Earp's The Social Engineer, published during the \"efficiency craze\" of 1911 in the U.S., a new usage of the term was launched that has since then become standard: \"Social engineering\" came to refer to an approach of treating social relations as \"machineries\",[1] to be dealt with in the manner of the technical engineer.[1]",
