  "content": "Lex mercatoria (from Latin for \"merchant law\"), often referred to as \"the Law Merchant\" in English, is the body of commercial law used by merchants throughout Europe[disputed \u2013 discuss] during the medieval period. It evolved similar to English common law as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It developed into an integrated body of law that was voluntarily produced, adjudicated and enforced on a voluntary basis[citation needed], alleviating the friction stemming from the diverse backgrounds and local traditions of the participants. Due to the international background local state law was not always applicable and the merchant law provided a leveled framework to conduct transactions reducing the preliminary of a trusted second party.[1][full citation needed] It emphasized contractual freedom and inalienability of property, while shunning legal technicalities[clarification needed] and deciding cases ex aequo et bono.[citation needed] With lex mercatoria professional merchants revitalized the almost nonexistent commercial activities in Europe, which had plummeted after the fall of the Roman Empire.[2]",
