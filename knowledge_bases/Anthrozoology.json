  "content": "Anthrozoology, also known as human\u2013animal studies (HAS), is the subset of ethnobiology that deals with interactions between humans and other animals. It is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with other disciplines including anthropology, ethnology, medicine, psychology, social work, veterinary medicine, and zoology. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human\u2013animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.[1] It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.[2][3][4] Anthrozoology scholars, such as Pauleen Bennett, recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human\u2013nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop sui generis methods.",
