  "content": "The Lower Paleolithic era on the Korean Peninsula and in Manchuria began roughly half a million years ago.[1][2][3] The earliest known Korean pottery dates to around 8000 BC and the Neolithic period began thereafter, followed by the Bronze Age by 2000 BC,[4][5][6] and the Iron Age around 700 BC. The Paleolithic people are likely not the direct ancestors of the present Korean people, but their direct ancestors are thought to be the Neolithic People of about 2000 BC.[7] According to the mythic account recounted in the Samguk yusa (1281), the Gojoseon kingdom was founded in northern Korea and southern Manchuria in 2333 BC.[8][9][10] The first written historical record on Gojoseon can be found from the text Guanzi.[11][12][13] The Jin state was formed in southern Korea by the 3rd century BC. In the late 2nd century BC, Gojoseon eventually fell to the Han dynasty of China, which led to succeeding warring states, the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms period. From the 1st century BC, Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla grew to control the peninsula and Manchuria as the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC\u2013668 AD), until unification by Silla in 676. In 698, Dae Jo-young established Balhae in the old territories of Goguryeo,[14][15] which led to the Northern and Southern States period (698\u2013926) with Balhae and Silla coexisting.",
