  "content": "Chemical biology is a scientific discipline between the fields of chemistry and biology. The discipline involves the application of chemical techniques, analysis, and often small molecules produced through synthetic chemistry, to the study and manipulation of biological systems.[1] Although often confused with biochemistry, which studies the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology remains distinct by focusing on the application of chemical tools to address biological questions.[2] Although considered a relatively new scientific field,[2] the term \"chemical biology\" has been in use since the early 20th century,[3] and has roots in scientific discovery from the early 19th century. The term 'chemical biology' can be traced back to an early appearance in a book published by Alonzo E. Taylor in 1907 titled \"On Fermentation\",[4] and was subsequently used in John B. Leathes' 1930 article titled \"The Harveian Oration on The Birth of Chemical Biology\".[5] However, it is unclear when the term was first used.[3]",
