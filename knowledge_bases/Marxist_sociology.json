Marxism itself is recognised as both a political philosophy and a social theory, insofar as it attempts to remain scientific, systematic, and objective rather than purely normative and prescriptive. This approach would come to facilitate the developments of critical theory and cultural studies as loosely distinct disciplines. Marx himself has been considered a founding father of sociology. The foundational basis of Marxist sociology is the investigation of capitalist stratification. An important concept of Marxist sociology is \"a form of conflict theory associated with\u2026Marxism's objective of developing a positive (empirical) science of capitalist society as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary working class.\"[2] The American Sociological Association (ASA) has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is \"interested in examining how insights from Marxist methodology and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society.\"[3]",
