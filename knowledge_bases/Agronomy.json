  "content": "Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants by agriculture for food, fuel, fiber, chemicals, recreation, or land conservation. Agronomy has come to include research of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of sciences such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Professionals of agronomy are termed agronomists. Early humans practiced hunter-gathering, but by around 10,000 BCE, they began to domesticate plants like wheat, barley and rice. This laid the foundation for agriculture. Ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Egyptians and Romans made significant advances in farming. They introduced irrigation systems, crop rotation, and early forms of fertilization. During this period, agricultural knowledge remained relatively static in Europe, though Islamic scholars made advances in agronomy. Ibn al-'Awwam, a 12th-century Andalusian agronomist, wrote the Kit\u0101b al-Fil\u0101\u1e25a, a comprehensive guide on farming practices, crop management and soil conservation.",
