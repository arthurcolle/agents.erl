Oomoto is often categorized as a new Japanese religion based on Shinto. The spiritual leaders of the movement have always been women within the Deguchi family,[2] along with Onisabur\u014d as its founding seishi (spiritual teacher). Since 2001, the movement has been guided by its fifth leader, Kurenai Deguchi. Deguchi Nao, a housewife from the tiny town of Ayabe, Kyoto Prefecture, declared that she had a \"spirit dream\" at the Japanese New Year in 1892, becoming possessed (kamigakari) by Ushitora no Konjin (\u826e\u306e\u91d1\u795e)) and starting to transmit his words. According to the official Oomoto biography of Deguchi, she came from a family which had long been in poverty, and had pawned nearly all of her possessions to feed her children and invalid husband. Deguchi was certainly not an otherwise famous figure, and independent accounts of her do not exist. After 1895, and with a growing number of followers, she became a teacher of the Konk\u014dky\u014d religion.",
