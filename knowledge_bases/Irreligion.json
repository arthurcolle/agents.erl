  "content": "Irreligion is the absence or rejection of religious beliefs or practices. It encompasses a wide range of viewpoints drawn from various philosophical and intellectual perspectives, including atheism, agnosticism, religious skepticism, rationalism, secularism, and non-religious spirituality. These perspectives can vary, with individuals who identify as irreligious holding diverse beliefs about religion and its role in their lives.[1] Relatively little scholarly research was published on non-belief until about 2010.[2] Over the past several decades,[when?] the number of secular persons has increased, with a rapid rise in early 21st century, in many countries.[3][4]: 4 [1][5]: 112 [6] In virtually every high-income country and many poor countries, religion has declined.[5]: 112 Highly secular societies tend to be societally healthy and successful.[7] Social scientists have predicted declines in religious beliefs and their replacement with more scientific/naturalistic outlooks (secularization hypothesis).[8] According to Ronald Inglehart, this trend seems likely to continue and a reverse rarely lasts long because the trend is driven by technological innovation.[9] However, other researchers disagree (contra-secularization hypothesis).[8] By 2050, Pew Research Center (Pew) expects irreligious people to probably decline as a share of the world population (16.4% to 13.2%), at least for a time, because of faster population growth in highly religious countries and shrinking populations in at least some less religious countries.[1][10] Many countries may also be gradually becoming more secular, generation by generation.[10] Younger generations tend to be less religious than their elders.[10][11]: 5 They might become more religious as they age, but still be less religious than previous generations if their countries become more affluent and stable.[11]: 13 Nonetheless, secularization is compatible with religion since most versions of secularity do not lead to atheism or irreligion.[12] Religious congruence, that is consistency between beliefs and behaviors, in individuals is rare.[13]: 2 Religious incongruence is not the same thing as religious insincerity or hypocrisy.[13]: 5 The widespread religious congruence fallacy occurs when interpretations or explanations unjustifiably presume religious congruence.[13]: 19 This fallacy also infects \"new atheist\" critiques of religion.[13]: 21",
