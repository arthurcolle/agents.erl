  "content": "Atmospheric science is the study of the Earth's atmosphere and its various inner-working physical processes. Meteorology includes atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric physics with a major focus on weather forecasting. Climatology is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time climate variability. Aeronomy is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of planetary science and the study of the atmospheres of the planets and natural satellites of the Solar System. Experimental instruments used in atmospheric science include satellites, rocketsondes, radiosondes, weather balloons, radars, and lasers. The term aerology (from Greek \u1f00\u03ae\u03c1, a\u0113r, \"air\"; and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia) is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth's atmosphere;[1] in other definitions, aerology is restricted to the free atmosphere, the region above the planetary boundary layer.[2]",
