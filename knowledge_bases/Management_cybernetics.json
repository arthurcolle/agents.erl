  "content": "Management cybernetics is concerned with the application of cybernetics to management and organizations. \"Management cybernetics\" was first introduced by Stafford Beer in the late 1950s[1] and introduces the various mechanisms of self-regulation applied by and to organizational settings, as seen through a cybernetics perspective. Beer developed the theory through a combination of practical applications and a series of influential books. The practical applications involved steel production, publishing and operations research in a large variety of different industries. Some consider that the full flowering of management cybernetics is represented in Beer's books.[2] However, learning continues (see below).[3] As practiced by Beer, research into operations involved multidisciplinary teams seeking practical assistance for difficult managerial issues.[4] It often involved the development of models borrowed from basic sciences and put into an isomorphic relationships with an organizational situation. Beer initially called this \"operations research\" (OR) but, along with Russell Ackoff, became increasingly disenchanted with that term as the field transitioned into one in which a predefined set of mathematical tools was applied to well-formulated problems.[citation needed] Beer's critique of traditional OR, in part, was that it became a matter of experts in mathematics looking for situations that could be conformed to their methods. Beer insisted that what was needed for effective research into operations was to first understand the key dynamics within the situation and only then to select the theory or methods that would allow one to understand that situation in detail. Beer's \"Decision and Control\", especially chapter six, discusses the methodology in some detail.[5]",
