  "content": "Parapsychology is the study of alleged psychic phenomena (extrasensory perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis (also called telekinesis), and psychometry) and other paranormal claims, for example, those related to near-death experiences, synchronicity, apparitional experiences, etc.[1] Criticized as being a pseudoscience, the majority of mainstream scientists reject it.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Parapsychology has also been criticized by mainstream critics for claims by many of its practitioners that their studies are plausible despite a lack of convincing evidence after more than a century of research for the existence of any psychic phenomena.[1][10][11] Parapsychology research rarely appears in mainstream scientific journals; a few niche journals publish most papers about parapsychology.[12] The term parapsychology was coined in 1889 by philosopher Max Dessoir as the German parapsychologie.[13][14] It was adopted by J. B. Rhine in the 1930s as a replacement for the term psychical research to indicate a significant shift toward experimental methodology and academic discipline.[15] The term originates from the Greek: \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac para meaning \"alongside\", and psychology.",
