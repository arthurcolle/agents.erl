Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four tirthankaras (supreme preachers of dharma), with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha, traditionally dated to the 9th century BCE, and the twenty-fourth tirthankara Mahavira, historically around the 6th or 5th BCE. Jainism is considered an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology. Central to understanding Jain philosophy is the concept of bhedavij\u00f1\u0101na, or the clear distinction in the nature of the soul and non-soul entities. This principle underscores the innate purity and potential for liberation within every soul, distinct from the physical and mental elements that bind it to the cycle of birth and rebirth. Recognizing and internalizing this separation is essential for spiritual progress and the attainment of samyaka dar\u015bana or self realization, which marks the beginning of the aspirant's journey towards liberation. The three main pillars of Jainism are ahi\u1e43s\u0101 (non-violence), anek\u0101ntav\u0101da (non-absolutism), and aparigraha (asceticism).",
