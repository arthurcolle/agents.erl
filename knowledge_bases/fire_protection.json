  "content": "Fire protection is the study and practice of mitigating the unwanted effects of potentially destructive fires.[1][2] It involves the study of the behaviour, compartmentalisation, suppression and investigation of fire and its related emergencies, as well as the research and development, production, testing and application of mitigating systems. In structures, be they land-based, offshore or even ships, the owners and operators are responsible to maintain their facilities in accordance with a design-basis that is rooted in laws, including the local building code and fire code, which are enforced by the authority having jurisdiction.[3] Buildings must be maintained in accordance with the current fire code, which is enforced by the fire prevention officers of a local fire department.[4][5] In the event of fire emergencies, Firefighters, fire investigators, and other fire prevention personnel are called to mitigate, investigate and learn from the damage of a fire.[6] When deciding on what fire protection is appropriate for any given situation, it is important to assess the types of fire hazards that may be faced.[7] Some jurisdictions operate systems of classifying fires using code letters.[8][9] Whilst these may agree on some classifications, they also vary. Below is a table showing the standard operated in Europe and Australia against the system used in the United States.",
