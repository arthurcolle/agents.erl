In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography comes from Greek steganographia, which combines the words stegan\u00f3s (\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"covered or concealed\", and -graphia (\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae) meaning \"writing\".[1] The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a formal shared secret are forms of security through obscurity, while key-dependent steganographic schemes try to adhere to Kerckhoffs's principle.[2]",
