  "content": "Cooperative learning is an educational approach which aims to organize classroom activities into academic and social learning experiences.[1] There is much more to cooperative learning than merely arranging students into groups, and it has been described as \"structuring positive interdependence.\"[2][3] Students must work in groups to complete tasks collectively toward academic goals. Unlike individual learning, which can be competitive in nature, students learning cooperatively can capitalize on one another's resources and skills (asking one another for information, evaluating one another's ideas, monitoring one another's work, etc.).[4][5] Furthermore, the teacher's role changes from giving information to facilitating students' learning.[6][7] Everyone succeeds when the group succeeds. Ross and Smyth (1995) describe successful cooperative learning tasks as intellectually demanding, creative, open-ended, and involve higher-order thinking tasks.[8] Cooperative learning has also been linked to increased levels of student satisfaction.[9][10]",
