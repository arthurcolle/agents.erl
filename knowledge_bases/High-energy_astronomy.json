  "content": "High-energy astronomy is the study of astronomical objects that release electromagnetic radiation of highly energetic wavelengths. It includes X-ray astronomy, gamma-ray astronomy, extreme UV astronomy, neutrino astronomy, and studies of cosmic rays. The physical study of these phenomena is referred to as high-energy astrophysics.[1] Astronomical objects commonly studied in this field may include black holes, neutron stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae, kilonovae, supernova remnants, and gamma-ray bursts. Some space and ground-based telescopes that have studied high energy astronomy include the following:[2] This astronomy-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
