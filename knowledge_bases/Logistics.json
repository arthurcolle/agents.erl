  "content": "Military logistics is the discipline of planning and carrying out the movement, supply, and maintenance of military forces. In its most comprehensive sense, it is those aspects or military operations that deal with: The word \"logistics\" is derived from the Greek adjective logistikos meaning \"skilled in calculating\",[1] and its corresponding Latin word logisticus. In turn this comes from the Greek logos, which refers to the principles of thought and action.[2] Another Latin root, log-, gave rise around 1380 to logio, meaning to lodge or dwell, and became the French verb loger, meaning \"to lodge\". Around 1670, the French King Louis XIV created the position of Mar\u00e9chal des logis, an officer responsible for planning marches, establishing camp sites, and regulating transport and supply. The term logistique soon came to refer to his duties.[3] It was in this sense that Antoine-Henri Jomini referred to the term in his Summary of the Art of War (1838). In the English translation, the word became \"logistics\".[4]",
