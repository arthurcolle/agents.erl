  "content": "Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient animals have moral worth independent of their utility to humans, and that their most basic interests\u2014such as avoiding suffering\u2014should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.[2] The argument from marginal cases is often used to reach this conclusion. This argument holds that if marginal human beings such as infants, senile people, and the cognitively disabled are granted moral status and negative rights, then nonhuman animals must be granted the same moral consideration, since animals do not lack any known morally relevant characteristic that marginal-case humans have. Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term \"animal rights\" is often used synonymously with \"animal protection\" or \"animal liberation\". More narrowly, \"animal rights\" refers to the idea that many animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as individuals\u2014rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture\u2014that may not be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare.[3]",
