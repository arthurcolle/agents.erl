  "content": "The politics of Canada functions within a framework of parliamentary democracy and a federal system of parliamentary government with strong democratic traditions.[1] Canada is a constitutional monarchy where the monarch is the ceremonial head of state. In practice, executive authority is entrusted to the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown chaired by the prime minister of Canada that act as the executive committee of the King's Privy Council for Canada and are responsible to the democratically elected House of Commons.[2] Canada is described as a \"full democracy\",[3] with a tradition of secular liberalism,[4] and an egalitarian,[5] moderate political ideology.[6][7][8] Extremism has never been prominent in Canadian politics.[9][10][11][12][13] The traditional \"brokerage\" model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology.[a][14] Peace, order, and good government, alongside an Implied Bill of Rights, are founding principles of the Canadian government.[15][16] An emphasis on multiculturalism and social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.[17][18][19] Canada has placed emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion for all its people.[20][21]",
