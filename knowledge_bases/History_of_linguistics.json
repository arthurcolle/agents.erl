  "content": "Linguistics is the scientific study of language,[1] involving analysis of language form, language meaning, and language in context.[2] Language use was first systematically documented in Mesopotamia, with extant lexical lists of the 3rd to the 2nd Millennia BCE, offering glossaries on Sumerian cuneiform usage and meaning, and phonetical vocabularies of foreign languages.[3][4] Later, Sanskrit would be systematically analysed, and its rules described, by P\u0101\u1e47ini (fl. 6-4th century BCE), in the Indus Valley.[5][6] Beginning around the 4th century BCE, Warring States period China also developed its own grammatical traditions.[7][citation needed] Aristotle laid the foundation of Western linguistics as part of the study of rhetoric in his Poetics c. 335 BC.[8] Traditions of Arabic grammar and Hebrew grammar developed during the Middle Ages in a religious context like P\u0101nini's Sanskrit grammar. Modern approaches began to develop in the 18th century, eventually being regarded in the 19th century as belonging to the disciplines of psychology or biology, with such views establishing the foundation of mainstream Anglo-American linguistics,[9] although in England philological approaches such as that of Henry Sweet tended to predominate. This was contested in the early 20th century by Ferdinand de Saussure, who established linguistics as an autonomous discipline within social sciences.[6] Following Saussure's concept, general linguistics consists of the study of language as a semiotic system, which includes the subfields of phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. Each of these subfields can be approached either synchronically or diachronicially.",
