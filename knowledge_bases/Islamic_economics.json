Therefore, it has its own economic system, which is based on its philosophical views and is compatible with the Islamic organization of other aspects of human behavior: social and political systems.[2] Islamic economics is a broad field, related to the more specific subset of Islamic commercial jurisprudence (Arabic: \u0641\u0642\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062a, fiqh al-mu'\u0101mal\u0101t). It is also an ideology of economics similar to the labour theory of value, which is \"labour-based exchange and exchange-based labour\".[3][4] While there are differences between the two, Islamic economics still tends to be closer to labor theory rather than subjective theory. Islamic commercial jurisprudence entails the rules of transacting finance or other economic activity in a Shari'a compliant manner,[5] i.e., a manner conforming to Islamic scripture (Quran and sunnah). Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) has traditionally dealt with determining what is required, prohibited, encouraged, discouraged, or just permissible.[6] according to the revealed word of God (Quran) and the religious practices established by Muhammad (sunnah). This applied to issues like property, money, employment, taxes, loans, along with everything else. The social science of economics,[6] on the other hand, works to describe, analyse and understand production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services,[7] and, studied how to best achieve policy goals, such as full employment, price stability, economic equity and productivity growth.[8]",
