  "content": "Applied science is the application of the scientific method and scientific knowledge to attain practical goals. It includes a broad range of disciplines, such as engineering and medicine. Applied science is often contrasted with basic science, which is focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict natural or other phenomena.[2] There are applied natural sciences, as well as applied formal and social sciences.[3] Applied science examples include genetic epidemiology which applies statistics and probability theory, and applied psychology, including criminology.[4] Applied research is the use of empirical methods to collect data for practical purposes. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques for a specific state, business, or client-driven purpose. In contrast to engineering, applied research does not include analyses or optimization of business, economics, and costs. Applied research can be better understood in any area when contrasting it with basic or pure research. Basic geographical research strives to create new theories and methods that aid in explaining the processes that shape the spatial structure of physical or human environments. Instead, applied research utilizes existing geographical theories and methods to comprehend and address particular empirical issues.[5] Applied research usually has specific commercial objectives related to products, procedures, or services.[6] The comparison of pure research and applied research provides a basic framework and direction for businesses to follow.[7]",
