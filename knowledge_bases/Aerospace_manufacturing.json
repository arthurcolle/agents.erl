  "content": "An aerospace manufacturer is a company or individual involved in the various aspects of designing, building, testing, selling, and maintaining aircraft, aircraft parts, missiles, rockets, or spacecraft. Aerospace is a high technology industry. The aircraft industry is the industry supporting aviation by building aircraft and manufacturing aircraft parts for their maintenance. This includes aircraft and parts used for civil aviation and military aviation. Most production is done pursuant to type certificates and Defense Standards issued by a government body. This term has been largely subsumed by the more encompassing term: \"aerospace industry\". In 2015 the aircraft production was worth US$180.3 billion: 61% airliners, 14% business and general aviation, 12% military aircraft, 10% military rotary wing and 3% civil rotary wing; while their MRO was worth $135.1 Bn or $315.4 Bn combined.[1] The global aerospace industry was worth $838.5 billion in 2017: aircraft & engine OEMs represented 28% ($235 Bn), civil & military MRO & upgrades 27% ($226 Bn), aircraft systems & component manufacturing 26% ($218 Bn), satellites & space 7% ($59 Bn), missiles & UAVs 5% ($42 Bn) and other activity, including flight simulators, defense electronics, public research accounted for 7% ($59 Bn).[2] The Top 10 countries with the largest industrial bases in 2017 were the United States with $408.4 billion (representing 49% of the whole), followed by France with $69 billion (8.2%), then China with $61.2 billion (7.3%), the United Kingdom with $48.8 billion (5.8%), Germany with $46.2 billion (5.5%), Russia with $27.1 billion (3.2%), Canada with $24 billion (2.9%), Japan with $21 billion (2.5%), Spain with $14 billion (1.7%) and India with $11 billion (1.3%). These ten countries represent $731 billion or 87.2% of the whole industry.[2]",
