  "content": "Entomology (from Ancient Greek \u1f14\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd (entomon) 'insect' and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 (-logia) 'study')[1] is the branch of zoology that focuses on insects. Those who study entomology are known as entomologists. In the past, the term insect was less specific, and historically the definition of entomology would also include the study of animals in other arthropod groups, such as arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. The field is also referred to as insectology in American English, while in British English insectology implies the study of the relationships between insects and humans.[2] Over 1.3 million insect species have been described by entomology.[3] Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping). The natural Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder (23\u201379 CE) wrote a book on the kinds of insects,[4] while the scientist of Kufa, Ibn al-A'r\u0101b\u012b (760\u2013845 CE) wrote a book on flies, Kit\u0101b al-Dab\u0101b (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0628\u0627\u0628). However scientific study in the modern sense began only relatively recently, in the 16th century.[5] Ulisse Aldrovandi's De Animalibus Insectis (Concerning Insect Animals) was published in 1602. Microscopist Jan Swammerdam published History of Insects, correctly describing the reproductive organs of insects and metamorphosis.[6] In 1705, Maria Sibylla Merian published the book Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium about the tropical insects of Dutch Surinam.[7]",
