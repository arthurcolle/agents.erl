  "content": "Business administration is the administration of a commercial enterprise.[1] It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising the business operations of an organization. The administration of a business includes the performance or management of business operations and decision-making, as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities towards common goals. In general, \"administration\" refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance, personnel and MIS services.[2] Administration can refer to the bureaucratic or operational performance of routine office tasks,[3] usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive. Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet an organization's goals. Henri Fayol (1841\u20131925) described these \"functions\" of the administrator as \"the five elements of administration\".[4] According to Fayol, the five functions of management are planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Without proper business management, a firm cannot utilize its resources properly so, it is the most important term in running a business firm.[5]",
