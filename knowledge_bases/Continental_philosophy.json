  "name": "Continental philosophy",
  "content": "Continental philosophy is an umbrella term for philosophies most prominent in continental Europe,[1][page needed] which the contemporary political thinker Michael E. Rosen has identified with certain common themes,[2] deriving from a broadly Kantian tradition and focused on personal philosophical reflection rather than exclusively empirical inquiry.[3] Continental philosophy includes German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism (and its antecedents, such as the thought of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche), hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, French feminism, psychoanalytic theory, and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School as well as branches of Freudian, Hegelian and Western Marxist views.[4] Continental philosophy is often contrasted with analytic philosophy.[5] There is no academic consensus on the definition of continental philosophy. Prior to the twentieth century, the term \"continental\" was used broadly to refer to philosophy from continental Europe.[6][7] A different use of the term originated among English-speaking philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, who used it to refer to a range of thinkers and traditions outside the analytic movement.[8] The term continental philosophy may mark merely a family resemblance across disparate philosophical views; Hans-Johann Glock has made a similar argument for analytic philosophy.[9] Simon Glendinning has suggested that the term \u201ccontinental philosophy\u201d was originally more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers.[10]",
