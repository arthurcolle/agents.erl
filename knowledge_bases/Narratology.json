  "content": "Narratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that these affect human perception.[1] The term is an anglicisation of French narratologie, coined by Tzvetan Todorov (Grammaire du D\u00e9cam\u00e9ron, 1969).[2] Its theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle (Poetics) but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian formalists, particularly Vladimir Propp (Morphology of the Folktale, 1928), and Mikhail Bakhtin's theories of heteroglossia, dialogism, and the chronotope first presented in The Dialogic Imagination (1975). Cognitive narratology is a more recent development that allows for a broader understanding of narrative. Rather than focus on the structure of the story, cognitive narratology asks \"how humans make sense of stories\" and \"how humans use stories as sense-making instruments\".[3] Structuralist narratologists like Rimmon-Kenan define narrative fiction as \"the narration of a succession of fictional events\".[4] Cognitive narratologists focus on how people experience something as narrative rather than on the structure of the text itself. The six-word story \"For sale: baby shoes, never worn\", is often given as an example that would not qualify as a narrative in the strictly structural approach, but that evokes a sense of narrative.",
