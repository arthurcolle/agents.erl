Interested in the social causes and consequences of how power is distributed and changes throughout and amongst societies, political sociology's focus ranges across individual families to the state as sites of social and political conflict and power contestation.[1][2] Political sociology was conceived as an interdisciplinary sub-field of sociology and politics in the early 1930s[2] throughout the social and political disruptions that took place through the rise of communism, fascism, and World War II.[3] This new area drawing upon works by Alexis de Tocqueville, James Bryce, Robert Michels, Max Weber, \u00c9mile Durkheim, and Karl Marx to understand an integral theme of political sociology: power.[4]",
