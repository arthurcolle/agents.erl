  "content": "Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories, methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper \"The Aims of Anthropology\".[1] John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as \"anthropology put to use\".[2] Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health, education, government, and business. In Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application, Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\".[3] In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community.",
