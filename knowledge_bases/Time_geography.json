  "content": "Time geography or time-space geography is an evolving transdisciplinary perspective on spatial and temporal processes and events such as social interaction, ecological interaction, social and environmental change, and biographies of individuals.[1] Time geography \"is not a subject area per se\",[2] but rather an integrative ontological framework and visual language in which space and time are basic dimensions of analysis of dynamic processes. Time geography was originally developed by human geographers, but today it is applied in multiple fields related to transportation, regional planning, geography, anthropology, time-use research, ecology, environmental science, and public health.[3] According to Swedish geographer Bo Lenntorp: \"It is a basic approach, and every researcher can connect it to theoretical considerations in her or his own way.\"[4] The Swedish geographer Torsten H\u00e4gerstrand created time geography in the mid-1960s based on ideas he had developed during his earlier empirical research on human migration patterns in Sweden.[5] He sought \"some way of finding out the workings of large socio-environmental mechanisms\" using \"a physical approach involving the study of how events occur in a time-space framework\".[6] H\u00e4gerstrand was inspired in part by conceptual advances in spacetime physics and by the philosophy of physicalism.[7]",
