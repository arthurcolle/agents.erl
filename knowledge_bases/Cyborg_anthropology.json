  "content": "Cyborg anthropology is a discipline that studies the interaction between humanity and technology from an anthropological perspective. The discipline offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society. Donna Haraway\u2019s 1984 \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg.[1] A sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled \"Cyborg Anthropology\", which cites Haraway's \"Manifesto\". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology.[2] The sub-group was closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science.[3] More recently, Amber Case has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public.[4] She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology.[5]",
