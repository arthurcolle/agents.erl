  "content": "Pharmacognosy is the study of crude drugs obtained from medicinal plants, animals, fungi, and other natural sources.[1] The American Society of Pharmacognosy defines pharmacognosy as \"the study of the physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological properties of drugs, drug substances, or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin as well as the search for new drugs from natural sources\".[2] The word \"pharmacognosy\" is derived from two Greek words: \u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd, pharmakon (drug), and \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 gnosis (knowledge) or the Latin verb cognosco (con, 'with', and gn\u014dsc\u014d, 'know'; itself a cognate of the Greek verb \u03b3\u03b9(\u03b3)\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9, gi(g)n\u00f3sko, meaning 'I know, perceive'),[3] meaning 'to conceptualize' or 'to recognize'.[4] The term \"pharmacognosy\" was used for the first time by the German physician Johann Adam Schmidt (1759\u20131809) in his published book Lehrbuch der Materia Medica in 1811, and by Anotheus Seydler in 1815, in his Analecta Pharmacognostica. Originally\u2014during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century\u2014\"pharmacognosy\" was used to define the branch of medicine or commodity sciences (Warenkunde in German) which deals with drugs in their crude, or unprepared form. Crude drugs are the dried, unprepared material of plant, animal or mineral origin, used for medicine. The study of these materials under the name Pharmakognosie was first developed in German-speaking areas of Europe, while other language areas often used the older term materia medica taken from the works of Galen and Dioscorides. In German, the term Drogenkunde (\"science of crude drugs\") is also used synonymously.",
