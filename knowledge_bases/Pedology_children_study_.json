    "content": "Paedology (also spelled pedology or paidology) is the study of children's behavior and development. It may be considered distinct from pedagogy, the art or science of teaching, and pediatrics, the field of medicine relating to children. However, pedology is not commonly recognized as a distinct field of study; therefore, many people who would be described as pedologists are instead described as pedagogues, pediatricians, psychologists, etc. Another factor that contributes to paedology's lack of recognition as a distinct field of study is because one could make contributions to the field of pedology while also making contributions to other fields. For example, Jean Piaget made contributions to the study of pedology in his theories of the cognitive development of children; however, Piaget has more commonly been recognized as a developmental psychologist. The origins of this trend in psychology and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or \"experimental pedagogic psychology\", \"experimental pedagogy\", \"experimental education\"."
