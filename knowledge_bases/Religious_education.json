  "name": "Religious education",
  "content": "In secular usage, religious education is the teaching of a particular religion (although in the United Kingdom the term religious instruction would refer to the teaching of a particular religion, with religious education referring to teaching about religions in general) and its varied aspects: its beliefs, doctrines, rituals, customs, rites, and personal roles. In Western and secular culture, religious education implies a type of education which is largely separate from academia, and which (generally) regards religious belief as a fundamental tenet and operating modality, as well as a prerequisite for attendance. The secular concept is substantially different from societies that adhere to religious law, wherein \"religious education\" connotes the dominant academic study, and in typically religious terms, teaches doctrines which define social customs as \"laws\" and the violations thereof as \"crimes\", or else misdemeanors requiring punitive correction. The free choice of religious education by parents according to their conviction is protected by Convention against Discrimination in Education.[1]",
