  "content": "Occupational therapy (OT), also known as ergotherapy, is a healthcare profession. Ergotherapy is derived from the Greek ergon which is allied to work, to act and to be active. Occupational therapy is based on the assumption that being active is a basic human need and that purposeful activity has a health-promoting and therapeutic effect. Occupational science the study of humans as 'doers' or 'occupational beings' was developed by inter-disciplinary scholars, including occupational therapists, in the 1980s. The World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) defines occupational therapy as \u2018a client-centred health profession concerned with promoting health and wellbeing through occupation. The primary goal of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in the activities of everyday life. Occupational therapists achieve this outcome by working with people and communities to enhance their ability to engage in the occupations they want to, need to, or are expected to do, or by modifying the occupation or the environment to better support their occupational engagement'.
