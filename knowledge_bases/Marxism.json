  "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Marxism is a political philosophy and method of socioeconomic analysis. It uses a dialectical and materialist interpretation of historical development,[1] better known as historical materialism, to analyse class relations, social conflict, and social transformation. Marxism originates with the works of 19th-century German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxism has developed over time into various branches and schools of thought, and as a result, there is no single, definitive \"Marxist theory\".[2] Marxism has had a profound effect in shaping the modern world, with various left-wing and far-left political movements taking inspiration from it in varying local contexts.[3][4][5] In addition to the various schools of thought, which emphasise or modify elements of classical Marxism, several Marxian concepts have been incorporated into an array of social theories. This has led to widely varying conclusions.[6] Alongside Marx's critique of political economy, the defining characteristics of Marxism have often been described using the terms \"dialectical materialism\" and \"historical materialism\", though these terms were coined after Marx's death and their tenets have been challenged by some self-described Marxists.[7]",
