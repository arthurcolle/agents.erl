  "content": "Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, cultures, societies, and linguistics, in both the present and past, including archaic humans.[1] Social anthropology studies patterns of behavior, while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning, including norms and values.[1] The term sociocultural anthropology is commonly used today. Linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.[1] Archaeology, often termed as \"anthropology of the past,\" studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence. It is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia, while in Europe, archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history and palaeontology. The abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history.[2][n 1] Its present use first appeared in Renaissance Germany in the works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann.[3] Their Neo-Latin anthropologia derived from the combining forms of the Greek words \u00e1nthr\u014dpos (\u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, \"human\") and l\u00f3gos (\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \"study\").[2] Its adjectival form appeared in the works of Aristotle.[2] It began to be used in English, possibly via French Anthropologie, by the early 18th century.[2][n 2]",
