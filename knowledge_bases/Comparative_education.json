  "content": "Comparative education is a discipline in the social sciences which entails the scrutiny and evaluation of different educational systems, such as those in various countries. Professionals in this area of endeavor are absorbed in advancing evocative terminologies and guidelines for education worldwide, enhancing educational structures and producing a context to which the success and effectivity of education programs and initiatives can be assessed.[1] According to Eckstein & Noah (1985),[2] and Farooq Joubish (2009),[citation needed] comparative education has five purposes: Comparative education is often incorrectly assumed to exclusively encompass studies that compare two or more different countries. In fact, since its early days researchers in this field have often also studied international institutions, international cooperation, and transnational influences on education systems and practices. Single-country and single-site studies have made important contributions to the field. Some large-scale projects, such as the PISA and TIMSS studies, have made important contributions to the field through explicitly comparative macro analysis of massive data sets.[citation needed]",
