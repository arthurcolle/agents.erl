  "content": "Business education is a branch of education that involves teaching the skills and operations of the business industry. This field of education occurs at multiple levels, including secondary and higher education At secondary level, Business Studies, as it is often called, typically combines elements of accountancy, finance, marketing, organizational studies, human resource management and economics.[1] The range of topics is designed to give the student a general overview of the various elements of running a business. Business is taught as an academic subject at high school level in many countries, including: Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Lesotho, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Sweden, Tanzania, Malaysia and the United Kingdom. Many school systems (additionally) examine accounting and economics as separate subjects; these offering a more technical orientation than the course in general business. Business mathematics may be included under business studies, or as a part of the mathematics syllabus.",
