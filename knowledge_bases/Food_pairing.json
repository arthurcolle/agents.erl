  "content": "Food pairing (or flavor pairing or food combination) is a method of identifying which foods go well together from a flavor standpoint, often based on individual tastes, popularity, availability of ingredients, and traditional cultural practices. From a food science perspective, foods may be said to combine well with one another when they share key chemical compounds[1] or flavor components. One such process was trademarked as \"Foodpairing\" by the company of the same name. One general pairing that is and has been very commonly used,[citation needed] cited as a response in \"your favorite food\" or \"food that you can eat every day\" surveys and seen in recipe videos, websites or books globally is: Pairings where the flavors of two foods specifically complement one another include: Experimenting with salty ingredients and chocolate around the year 2000, Heston Blumenthal, the chef of The Fat Duck, concluded that caviar and white chocolate were a perfect match.[2] To find out why, he contacted a flavor scientist at Firmenich, the flavor manufacturer. By comparing the flavor analysis of both foods, they found that caviar and white chocolate had major flavor components in common. At that time, they formed the hypothesis that different foods would combine well together when they shared major flavor components, and the trademarked concept of \"Foodpairing\" was created.[3][clarification needed]",
