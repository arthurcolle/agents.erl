  "content": "A playwright or dramatist is a person who writes plays, which are a form of drama that primarily consists of dialogue between characters and is intended for theatrical performance rather than just reading. Ben Jonson coined the term \"playwright\" and is the first person in English literature to refer to playwrights as separate from poets. The earliest playwrights in Western literature with surviving works are the Ancient Greeks. William Shakespeare is amongst the most famous playwrights in literature, both in England and across the world. The word \"play\" is from Middle English pleye, from Old English pl\u00e6\u0121, ple\u0121a, pl\u00e6\u0121a (\"play, exercise; sport, game; drama, applause\").[1] The word wright is an archaic English term for a craftsperson or builder (as in a wheelwright or cartwright).[2] The words combine to indicate a person who has \"wrought\" words, themes, and other elements into a dramatic form\u2014a play. (The homophone with \"write\" is coincidental.) The first recorded use of the term \"playwright\" is from 1605,[3] 73 years before the first written record of the term \"dramatist\".[4] It appears to have been first used in a pejorative sense by Ben Jonson[5] to suggest a mere tradesman fashioning works for the theatre.",
