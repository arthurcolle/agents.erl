  "content": "An art school is an educational institution with a primary focus on practice and related theory in the visual arts and design. This includes fine art \u2013 especially illustration, painting, contemporary art, sculpture, and graphic design. They may be independent or operate within a larger institution, such as a university. Some may be associated with an art museum. Art schools can offer elementary, secondary, post-secondary, undergraduate or graduate programs, and can also offer a broad-based range of programs (such as the liberal arts and sciences). In the West there have been six major periods of art school curricula,[1] and each one has had its own hand in developing modern institutions worldwide throughout all levels of education. Art schools also teach a variety of non-academic skills to many students. Nicholas Houghton identifies six definitive historical art-school curricula in the Western tradition of art and art education: \"apprentice, academic, formalist, expressive, conceptual, and professional\".[1][2] Each of these curricula has aided not only the way that modern art-schools teach, but also how students learn about art.",
