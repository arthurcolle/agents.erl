  "content": "Archaeological science consists of the application of scientific techniques to the analysis of archaeological materials and sites. It is related to methodologies of archaeology. Martin\u00f3n-Torres and Killick distinguish \u2018scientific archaeology\u2019 (as an epistemology) from \u2018archaeological science\u2019 (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).[1] Martin\u00f3n-Torres and Killick claim that \u2018archaeological science\u2019 has promoted the development of high-level theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.[2] In the United Kingdom, the Natural and Environmental Research Council provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.[3] Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:[4] Techniques such as lithic analysis, archaeometallurgy, paleoethnobotany, palynology and zooarchaeology also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.",
