  "content": "Prehistoric warfare refers to war that occurred between societies without recorded history. The existence\u2014and the definition\u2014of war in humanity's hypothetical state of nature has been a controversial topic in the history of ideas at least since Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan (1651) argued a \"war of all against all\", a view directly challenged by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in a Discourse on Inequality (1755) and The Social Contract (1762). The debate over human nature continues, spanning contemporary anthropology, archaeology, ethnography, history, political science, psychology, primatology, and philosophy in such divergent books as Azar Gat's War in Human Civilization and Raymond C. Kelly's Warless Societies and the Origin of War.[1][2] For the purposes of this article, \"prehistoric war\" will be broadly defined as a state of organized lethal aggression between autonomous preliterate communities.[3][4] Some scientists argue that humans have a predisposition for violence.[5] Chimpanzees, the great apes genetically closest to humans,[6] are known to wage wars over territories and resources.[5]",
