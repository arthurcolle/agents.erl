  "content": "Museology (also called museum studies or museum science) is the study of museums. It explores the history of museums and their role in society, as well as the activities they engage in, including curating, preservation, public programming, and education. The words that are used to describe the study of museums vary depending on language and geography. For example, while \"museology\" is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (mus\u00e9ologie), Spanish (museolog\u00eda), German (Museologie), Italian (museologia), and Portuguese (museologia) \u2013 while English speakers more often use the term \"museum studies\" to refer to that same field of study.[1] When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the Greek \"museographia\" (French: mus\u00e9ographie, Spanish: museograf\u00eda, German: Museographie, Italian: museografia, Portuguese: museografia), while English speakers typically use the term \"museum practice\" or \"operational museology\"[2]",
