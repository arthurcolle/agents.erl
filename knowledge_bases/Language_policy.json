  "content": "Language policy is both an interdisciplinary academic field[1] and implementation of ideas about language use.[2] Some scholars such as Joshua Fishman and Ofelia Garc\u00eda consider it as part of sociolinguistics. On the other hand, other scholars such as Bernard Spolsky, Robert B. Kaplan and Joseph Lo Bianco argue that language policy is a branch of applied linguistics. As a field, language policy is also known as language planning or language policy and planning,[1] and is related to other fields such as language ideology, language revitalization, and language education, among others. Language policy has been defined in a number of ways. According to Kaplan and Baldauf (1997), \"A language policy is a body of ideas, laws, regulations, rules and practices intended to achieve the planned language change in the societies, group or system\" (p. xi[3]). Lo Bianco defines the field as \"a situated activity, whose specific history and local circumstances influence what is regarded as a language problem, and whose political dynamics determine which language problems are given policy treatment\u201d (p. 152).[4] McCarty (2011) defines language policy as \"a complex sociocultural process [and as] modes of human interaction, negotiation, and production mediated by relations of power. The 'policy' in these processes resides in their language-regulating power; that is, the ways in which they express normative claims about legitimate and illegitimate language forms and uses, thereby governing language statuses and uses\" (p. 8).[5]",
