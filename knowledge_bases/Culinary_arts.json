  "content": "Culinary arts are the cuisine arts of food preparation, cooking, and presentation of food, usually in the form of meals.[1][2] People working in this field \u2013 especially in establishments such as restaurants \u2013 are commonly called chefs or cooks, although, at its most general, the terms culinary artist and culinarian are also used. Expert chefs are in charge of making meals that are both aesthetically beautiful and delicious. This often requires understanding of food science, nutrition, and diet. Delicatessens and relatively large institutions like hotels and hospitals rank as their principal workplaces after restaurants. The origins of culinary arts began with primitive humans roughly 2 million years ago.[3] Various theories exist as to how early humans used fire to cook meat. According to anthropologist Richard Wrangham, author of Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human,[4] primitive humans simply tossed a raw hunk of meat into the flames and watched it sizzle. Another theory claims humans may first have savoured roasted meat by chance when the flesh of a beast killed in a forest fire was found to be more appetizing and easier to chew and digest than conventional raw meat.[5]",
