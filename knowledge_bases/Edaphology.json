  "content": "Edaphology (from Greek \u1f14\u03b4\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, edaphos 'ground' + -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, -logia) is concerned with the influence of soils on living beings, particularly plants.[1][2][3] It is one of two main divisions of soil science, the other being pedology.[4][5][6] Edaphology includes the study of how soil influences humankind's use of land for plant growth[7] as well as people's overall use of the land.[8] General subfields within edaphology are agricultural soil science (known by the term agrology in some regions) and environmental soil science.[9] Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification. The history of edaphology is not simple, as the two main alternative terms for soil science\u2014pedology and edaphology\u2014were initially poorly distinguished.[10] Friedrich Albert Fallou originally conceived pedology in the 19th century as a fundamental science separate from the applied science of agrology,[11] a predecessor term for edaphology,[12] a distinction retained in the current understanding of edaphology. During the 20th century, the term edaphology was \"driven out of [pedology-centric] soil science\" but remained in use to address edaphic problems in other disciplines.[13] In the case of Russian soil scientists, edaphology was used as an equivalent term to pedology,[14] and in Spain, soil scientists adopted edaphology in preference to the term pedology.[15] In the 21st century, edaphology is recognized by soil scientists as a branch of soil science necessary and complementary to the pedology branch.[16]",
