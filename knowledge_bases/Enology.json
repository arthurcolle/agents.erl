Oenology is distinct from viticulture, which is the science of the growing, cultivation, and harvesting of grapes.[3] The English word oenology derives from the Greek word oinos (\u03bf\u1f36\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) \"wine\" and the suffix \u2013logia (-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1) the \"study of\". An oenologist is an expert in the science of wine and of the arts and techniques for making wine. University programs in oenology and viticulture usually feature a concentration in science for the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S, B.Sc., Sc.B), and as a terminal master's degree \u2014 either in a scientific or in a research program for the degree of Master of Science (M.S., Sc.M.), e.g. the master of professional studies degree. Oenologists and viticulturalists with doctorates often have a background in horticulture, plant physiology, and microbiology. Related to oenology are the professional titles of sommelier and master of wine, which are specific certifications in the restaurant business and in hospitality management. Occupationally, oenologists usually work as winemakers, as wine chemists in commercial laboratories, and in oenologic organisations, such as the Australian Wine Research Institute.",
