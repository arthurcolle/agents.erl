  "content": "Cognitive archaeology is a theoretical perspective in archaeology that focuses on the ancient mind. It is divided into two main groups: evolutionary cognitive archaeology (ECA), which seeks to understand human cognitive evolution from the material record, and ideational cognitive archaeology (ICA), which focuses on the symbolic structures discernable in or inferable from past material culture. ECA infers change in ancestral human cognition from the archaeological record, often drawing on the theories, methods, and data of other disciplines: cognitive science, comparative cognition, paleoneurology, experimental replication, and hands-on participation in the manufacture and use of traditional technologies.[1] For example, the 3.3-million-year history[2] of stone tool use is broadly informative of change in cognitive capacities like intelligence, spatial reasoning,[3][4] working memory, and executive functioning,[5][6] as defined by and understood through cognitive psychology and as operationalized to permit their detection in the archaeological record.[1] Other ECA investigations have focused on the development of domain-specific abilities, including theory of mind,[7] visual perception and visuospatial abilities,[8][9] technological reasoning,[10][11] language,[12] numeracy,[13][14] and literacy.[15][16][17] ECA is broadly analogous to Steven Mithen's categories of cognitive-processual and evolutionary-cognitive archaeology.[18]",
