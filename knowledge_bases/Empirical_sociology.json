Describes the situation of the aspects of social life such as economy, law, family, and politics during the research.[1] Empirical sociology is often concerned with aspects of everyday life with common sense, which it treats as a resource, a form of knowledge.[2] Empirical sociology inductively studies how people appreciate and get along with each other.[3] Empirical sociology is an American tradition with roots in the social reform movements of the Progressive Era.[4] The task of empirical sociology is to conduct inductive research on a particular social phenomenon.[5] The German sociologist Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies defined empirical sociology as the collection of factual information or evidence.[6][7] Sociologist Morris Janowitz defined empirical sociology as collecting and planning empirical indicators of change.[8] Morris describes the relationship between history and empirical sociology as \"At this point, sociology and \"history\u201d converge. All empirical sociology is history, but history is not all empirical sociology\".[8]",
