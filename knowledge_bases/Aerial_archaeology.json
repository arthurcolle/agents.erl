  "content": "Aerial archaeology is the study of archaeological sites from the air. It is a method of archaeological investigation that uses aerial photography, remote sensing, and other techniques to identify, record, and interpret archaeological features and sites.[1] Aerial archaeology has been used to discover and map a wide range of archaeological sites, from prehistoric settlements and ancient roads to medieval castles and World War II battlefields. Aerial archaeology involves interpretation and image analysis of photographic and other kinds of images in field research to understand archaeological features, sites, and landscapes. It enables exploration and examination of context and large land areas, on a scale unparalleled by other archaeological methods. The AARG (Aerial Archaeology Research Group) boasts that \"more archaeological features have been found worldwide through aerial photography than by any other means of survey\".[2] Aerial archaeological survey combines data collection and data analysis.[3] The umbrella term \"aerial images'\" includes traditional aerial photographs, satellite images, multispectral data (which captures image data within specific wavelength ranges across the electromagnetic spectrum)[4] and hyperspectral data (similar to multi-spectral data, but more detailed).",
