  "content": "Sports biomechanics is the quantitative based study and analysis of athletes and sports activities in general. It can simply be described as the physics of sports. Within this specialized field of biomechanics, the laws of mechanics are applied in order to gain a greater understanding of athletic performance through mathematical modeling, computer simulation and measurement. Biomechanics, as a broader discipline, is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of mechanics (the branch of physics involving analysis of the actions of forces). Within mechanics there are two sub-fields of study: statics, which is the study of systems that are in a state of constant motion either at rest (with no motion) or moving with a constant velocity; and dynamics, which is the study of systems in motion in which acceleration is present, which may involve kinematics (the study of the motion of bodies with respect to time, displacement, velocity, and speed of movement either in a straight line or in a rotary direction) and kinetics (the study of the forces associated with motion, including forces causing motion and forces resulting from motion).[1] Sports biomechanists help people obtain optimal muscle recruitment and performance. A biomechanist also uses their knowledge to apply proper load barring techniques to preserve the body.[2]",
