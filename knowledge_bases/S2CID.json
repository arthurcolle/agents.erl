  "content": "Semantic Scholar is a research tool for scientific literature. It is developed at the Allen Institute for AI and was publicly released in November 2015.[2] Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process, for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers.[3] The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing, machine learning, human\u2013computer interaction, and information retrieval.[4] Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science, geoscience, and neuroscience.[5] In 2017, the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus.[5] As of September 2022[update], it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science.[6] Semantic Scholar provides a one-sentence summary of scientific literature. One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices.[7] It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers, since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read.[8]",
