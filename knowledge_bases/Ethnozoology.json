  "name": "Ethnozoology",
  "content": "Ethnozoology is a field of study that explores the complex relationships between humans and animals in their environment.[1] This discipline encompasses the classification and naming of various animal species, as well as the cultural knowledge and use of both wild and domesticated animals.[2] Ethnozoology is a subdiscipline of ethnobiology, which also includes ethnobotany, the study of human-plant relationships. However, unlike ethnobotany, ethnozoology focuses specifically on human-animal relationships and the knowledge that humans have acquired about the animals in their surroundings. The study of ethnozoology sheds light on the roles that animals have played in human societies throughout history, from their utilitarian functions to their cultural, religious, artistic, and philosophical significance. Ethnozoology can be approached from various perspectives, such as ecological, cognitive, and symbolic, and it connects scientific methods to traditional systems of knowledge and cultural beliefs.",
