  "content": "The Balkans, partly corresponding with the Balkan Peninsula, encompasses areas that may also be placed in Southeastern, Southern, Eastern Europe and Central Europe. The distinct identity and fragmentation of the Balkans owes much to its often turbulent history, with the region experiencing centuries of Ottoman conflict and conquest. The Balkan Peninsula is predominantly mountainous, featuring several mountain ranges such as the Dinaric Alps, the Pindus Mountains and the Balkan Mountains.[1][2] First human settlement in Europe is Iron Gates Mesolithic (11000 to 6000 BC), located in Danube River, in modern Serbia and Romania. It has been described as \"the first city in Europe\",[3][4] due to its permanency, organisation, as well as the sophistication of its architecture and construction techniques. Archaeologists have identified several early culture-complexes, including the Cucuteni culture (4500 to 3500 BC), Starcevo culture (6500 to 4000 BC), Vin\u010da culture (5500 to 3000 BC), Linear pottery culture (5500 to 4500 BC), and Ezero culture (3300\u20142700 BC). The Eneolithic Varna culture in Bulgaria (4600\u20134200 BC radiocarbon dating) produced the world's earliest known gold treasure and had sophisticated beliefs about afterlife. A notable set of artifacts are the T\u0103rt\u0103ria tablets found in Romania, which appear to be inscribed with proto-writing.",
