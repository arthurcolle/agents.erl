  "content": "Counterinsurgency (COIN, or NATO spelling counter-insurgency[1]) is \"the totality of actions aimed at defeating irregular forces\".[2] The Oxford English Dictionary defines counterinsurgency as any \"military or political action taken against the activities of guerrillas or revolutionaries\"[3] and can be considered war by a state against a non-state adversary.[4] Insurgency and counterinsurgency campaigns have been waged since ancient history. Western thought on fighting 'small wars' gained interest during initial periods of European colonisation,[5] with modern thinking on counterinsurgency was developed during decolonization.[4] During insurgency and counterinsurgency, the distinction between civilians and combatants is often blurred.[6] Counterinsurgency may involve attempting to win the hearts and minds of populations supporting the insurgency.[7][8] Alternatively, it may be waged in an attempt to intimidate[4][9] or eliminate civilian populations suspected of loyalty to the insurgency through indiscriminate violence.[4][10]",
