  "content": "Military sports are sports practiced by the military. They are the subject of international competitions, such as the Military World Games, with an objective relating to the physical training of military. Particular sports may be chosen to improve combat readiness, skill, toughness, the development of physical qualities of the warfighter, and professional proficiency based on the different areas of the military action: land, sea and air. In 1858 Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford, England and in 1860 instituted a training regimen for 12 non-commissioned officers and their officer Major Frederick Hammersley at the university.[1] This regimen was assimilated into the training of the British Army, which formed the Army Gymnastic Staff in 1861 and made sport an important part of military life.[2][3][4] In the United States, the first Inter-service Sports Council (ISSC) meeting was held in 1947.[5] Today, Armed Forces Sports in the U.S. are run through the Department of Defense.",
