  "content": "Enzymes (/\u02c8\u025bnza\u026amz/) are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.[1]: 8.1 Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called enzymology and the field of pseudoenzyme analysis recognizes that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties.[2][3] Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types.[4] Other biocatalysts include catalytic RNA molecules, also called ribozymes. They are sometimes described as a type of enzyme rather than being like an enzyme, but even in the decades since ribozymes' discovery in 1980\u20131982, the word enzyme alone often means the protein type specifically (as is used in this article). A third category of biocatalysts is constituted by those biomolecular condensates that have catalytic ability.[5]",
