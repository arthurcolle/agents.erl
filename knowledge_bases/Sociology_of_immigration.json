Important concepts include assimilation, enculturation, marginalization, multiculturalism, postcolonialism, transnationalism and social cohesion. Nativism has a long history in many societies.. Global migration during the twentieth century grew particularly during the first half of the century. Due to World War I and World War II, European immigrants came to the United States (for example) in vast[quantify] quantities. Particularly following the end (1918) of World War I, some Americans labeled European immigrants as dangerous to American culture.[1] In 1924 the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which placed strict quotas on immigrants entering the United States.[1] During the 1920s -1930s women's citizenship was all dependent on a father or husband, so because of the rules many women used marriage as a way to immigrate. This means that for many women they are tied to becoming either a wife or mother.[2]",
