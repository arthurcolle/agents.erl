  "content": "Empirical methods Prescriptive and policy Entrepreneurship is the creation or extraction of economic value in ways that generally entail beyond the minimal amount of risk (assumed by a traditional business), and potentially involving values besides simply economic ones. An entrepreneur (French: [\u0251\u0303t\u0281\u0259p\u0281\u0259n\u0153\u0281]) is an individual who creates and/or invests in one or more businesses, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards.[1] The process of setting up a business is known as \"entrepreneurship\". The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business/or procedures. More narrow definitions have described entrepreneurship as the process of designing, launching and running a new business, often similar to a small business, or (per Business Dictionary) as the \"capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit\".[2] The people who create these businesses are often referred to as \"entrepreneurs\".[3][4]",
