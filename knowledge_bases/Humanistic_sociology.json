  "content": "Humanistic sociology is a domain of sociology which originated mainly from the work of the University of Chicago Polish philosopher-turned-sociologist, Florian Znaniecki. It is a methodology which treats its objects of study and its students, that is, humans, as composites of values and systems of values.[clarification needed][1] In certain contexts, the term is related to other sociological domains such as antipositivism. Humanistic sociology seeks to shed light on questions such as, \"What is the relationship between a man of principle and a man of opportunism?\" Humanistic sociology is a domain of sociology that grew from Anti positivism. It originated from the initial work of Florian Witold Znaniecki and W. I. Thomas who co-authored The Polish Peasant in Europe and America.[2] Thomas, due to his multi-ethnic background, was fluent in Polish. He developed the life-history methodology,[3] where data is obtained from letters and other materials, such as the archives of the Polish Emigrants Protective Association, of which Znaniecki was a director. Znaniecki was a philosopher who opposed idealism and naturalism, proposing instead a methodology for social research based around the \"humanistic coefficient\", sometimes known as the humanist principle. The outbreak of World War I led Znaniecki to join Thomas at Chicago.",
