  "content": "The Mississippian culture were collections of Native American societies that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from approximately 800 to 1600 CE, varying regionally. It was known for building large, earthen platform mounds, and often other shaped mounds as well.[1][2] It was composed of a series of urban settlements and satellite villages linked together by loose trading networks.[3] The largest city was Cahokia, believed to be a major religious center, located in what is present-day southern Illinois. The Mississippian way of life began to develop in the Mississippi River Valley (for which it is named). Cultures in the tributary Tennessee River Valley may have also begun to develop Mississippian characteristics at this point. Almost all dated Mississippian sites predate 1539\u20131540 (when Hernando de Soto explored the area),[4] with notable exceptions being Natchez communities. These maintained Mississippian cultural practices into the 18th century.[5]",
