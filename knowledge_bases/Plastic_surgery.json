  "content": "Plastic surgery is a surgical specialty involving the restoration, reconstruction, or alteration of the human body. It can be divided into two main categories: reconstructive surgery and cosmetic surgery. Reconstructive surgery covers a wide range of specialties, including craniofacial surgery, hand surgery, microsurgery, and the treatment of burns. This category of surgery focuses on restoring a body part or improving its function. In contrast, cosmetic (or aesthetic) surgery focuses solely on improving the physical appearance of the body.[1][2] A comprehensive definition of plastic surgery has never been established, because it has no distinct anatomical object and thus overlaps with practically all other surgical specialties. An essential feature of plastic surgery is that it involves the treatment of conditions that require or may require tissue relocation skills. The word plastic in plastic surgery is in reference to the concept of \"reshaping\" and comes from the Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (\u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7), plastik\u0113 (tekhn\u0113), \"the art of modelling\" of malleable flesh.[3] This meaning in English is seen as early as 1598.[4] In the surgical context, the word \"plastic\" first appeared in 1816 and was established in 1838 by Eduard Zeis,[5] preceding the modern technical usage of the word as \"engineering material made from petroleum\" by 70 years.[6]",
