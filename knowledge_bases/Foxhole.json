  "content": "A defensive fighting position is a type of earthwork constructed in a military context, generally large enough to accommodate anything from one soldier to a fire team (or similar sized unit). Tobruk type positions are named after the system of defensive positions constructed, initially, by the Italian Army at Tobruk, Libya. After Tobruk fell to the Allies in January 1941, the existing positions were modified and significantly expanded by the Australian Army which, along with other Allied forces, reused them in the Siege of Tobruk. A foxhole is one type of defensive strategic position. It is a \"small pit used for cover, usually for one or two personnel, and so constructed that the occupants can effectively fire from it\".[1] It is known more commonly within United States Army slang as a \"fighting position\" or as a \"ranger grave\". It is known as a \"fighting hole\" in the United States Marine Corps, a \"gun-pit\" in Australian Army terminology, and a \"fighting pit\" in the New Zealand Army.",
